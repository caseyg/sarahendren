<p>Here's the sticker project in the current issue (<em>Editing Urbanism</em>) of <a href="http://www.monu-magazine.com/">MONU, the Magazine on Urbanism</a>, out of Rotterdam. And this coming Monday night I'll be speaking about the sticker project and my work at <a href="http://boston.nerdnite.com/2011/07/19/nerdnite-july-25-totally-awesome/">Nerd Nite Boston</a>—they're collaborating with the Awesome Foundation for this month's lectures. Nerd Nite hosts regular short talks, usually at a bar, with a DJ before and after—"like the Discovery Channel," they say, "with beer."</p>
<p>With my grant from the <a href="http://awesomefoundation.org/">Awesome Foundation</a>, I was able to amp up the visibility of the sticker image with more opaque ink and order a large new print run. There's a big box in my living room now. Contact me if you want some!</p>
