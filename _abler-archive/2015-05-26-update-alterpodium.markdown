There's a full report coming about students' work on [the alterpodium](http://ablersite.org/2014/08/28/an-alterpodium-design-for-one-series/), along with images ofÂ the final prototype (in carbon fiber!), but I'm just sharing with you this gif so you get a sense for the interaction, assembly and disassembly.
