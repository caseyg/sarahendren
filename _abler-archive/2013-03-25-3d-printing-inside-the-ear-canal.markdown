From [Wired Design](http://www.wired.com/design/2013/03/ear-canal-3-d-scanner/):

"[Lantos Technologies](http://www.lantostechnologies.com/), a small startup spun out of MIT, has created the first [FDA-cleared](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf12/K121326.pdf) digital ear-canal scanner. While that may seem wildly specific, and maybe a little gross, it could dramatically improve your grandfather’s hearing aid, Lady Gaga’s in-ear monitor, and mission-critical communication devices used by the military.

The Lantos 3-D Ear Canal Scanner should be rolling out to audiologists by the end of the year and brings much-needed innovation to the [36 million Americans](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-08/the-battle-to-build-and-sell-hearing-aid-alternatives.html) who suffer from hearing problems and spend $6 billion dollars on hearing aids annually.

"The current technology used in hearing aids is great, but we’re using 1950s technology for the molds,' says [Dr. Richard Kanor](https://twitter.com/bkaudiology), a Brooklyn-based audiologist with over [30 years](http://hearingaidexperts.com/) of experience. 'The holy grail has always been a more accurate, faster 3-D representation of the ear canal.'"
