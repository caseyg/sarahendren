<p>I had an exchange with <a href="http://www.mkontopoulos.com/">Michael Kontopoulos</a> about <a href="http://www.mkontopoulos.com/?p=847">"Water Rites,"</a> a design fiction where literal and cultural relationships with water are "far less cavalier." Kontopoulos was intrigued by science fiction narratives like that of Richard Heinlein's <em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em>; in that story, an arid planet creates social rituals around water—the resource becomes precious, sacred:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Water Rites</em> addresses the social response to the diminishing quantity of a resource. [...] Making, moving and, most notably, sharing it carries with it a heightened social significance in the moral order.*</p>

<p>I love the devices Kontopoulos constructed for gathering, consecrating, and imbibing. "I was drawn towards an aesthetic conflation of laboratory equipment and religious altars," he told me. "There's something about care/veneration for the hazardous or precious that I was gleaning from the way chemicals are handled in lab environments—I wanted to transpose those kinds of gestures onto this ceremony."</p>
<p>The speculation in the design is just uncanny enough to be believable—a mix of dark wood, glass and tubing. The referents are both past- and future-oriented.</p>

<p>And Kontopoulos is based in L.A., a city rife with threats to water resources right now.</p>
<p>These works—the film and devices—are currently on view in <a href="http://www.welcometolace.org/exhibitions/view/speculative/"><em>Speculative</em></a>, at Los Angeles Contemporary Projects through August 28. Here's the video:</p>
