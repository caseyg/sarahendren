I'll be [speaking at Nerd Nite](http://boston.nerdnite.com/2014/01/17/nerd-nite-january-2014/) on Monday, January 27, all about the inclined plane—in utopian architecture, interstate freeways, for skateboarders and on Mars—as well as my ongoing project, [Slope : Intercept](http://slopeintercept.org/). Starts at 8 pm at Middlesex Lounge in Cambridge. Plus another talk about the hidden lives of public libraries!

[![A house in Osaka, where an inclined plane covered in astroturf bridges indoor and outdoor space: windows to the outside on each end of the slope, and a skylight overhead. An invitation to lie on the grass, but with shelter.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/osaka.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/osaka.jpg)
