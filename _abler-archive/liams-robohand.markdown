[![A child's prosthetic hand, made from lightweight plastic parts, with finger digits and a fully integrated structure for movement](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/liams_robohand1.jpeg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/liams_robohand1.jpeg)

3D printing is a perfect match for lightweight prosthetics, it turns out. The material makes so much sense for children, whose parts will invariably need to be re-sized and whose use of force is still in development. I covered the ["magic arms"](http://ablersite.org/2012/08/02/magic-arms/) a few months ago; the promise of these printed parts' physical qualities, plus resources like [openSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), just keeps getting better. The designer-engineers just made the project entirely open-source over at [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44150).

The video below tracks Liam on Day 3 of his new hand's use—practicing the fine art of picking up coins from a table and throwing a ball.
