Takehito Etani's [Masticator](http://www.takehitoetani.com/masticator.html) anatomizes the physical laboriousness of chewing[. This video shows it in action](http://www.takehitoetani.com/masti/masti_demo_web.mov)—counting out each movement.

Made of pig skin, human bones, and electronics, it's like an exoskeletal medical lesson. Like a physical system, unzipped and turned inside-out.

I like this analog-digital hybrid form for a bunch of reasons, but I really like that it opens up the animality of the body-machine. I've written about body horror [elsewhere here](http://www.ablersite.org/2010/09/but-he-does-like-robo-cop/)—and this is a revealing look at the ways we hide the mundane facts of our physical processes, especially that of drool—of spilled fluids, messy processes, lack of control. (Edit: Isn't it interesting that drool holds none of the transgressive appeal of blood, urine, other body fluids?)
