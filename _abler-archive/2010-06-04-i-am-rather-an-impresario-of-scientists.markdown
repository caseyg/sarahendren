Stefany Anne Goldberg [examines](http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article06021001.aspx) Jacques Cousteau's life of exploration and discovers a big dreamer.

Cousteau was a storyteller, and only able to gather support for his projects as long as he was able to ignite the interest of collaborators. "I am not a scientist," Cousteau told _The Christian Science Monitor_ in 1986. "I am, rather, an impresario of scientists."

"Whether he wanted to or not," Goldberg writes, "Cousteau turned the explorer from a man giving answers into a person looking at the world with questions, and then finally looking inward with those questions."
