<p>Stefany Anne Goldberg <a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article06021001.aspx">examines</a> Jacques Cousteau's life of exploration and discovers a big dreamer.</p>
<p>Cousteau was a storyteller, and only able to gather support for his projects as long as he was able to ignite the interest of collaborators. "I am not a scientist," Cousteau told <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em> in 1986. "I am, rather, an impresario of scientists."</p>
<p>"Whether he wanted to or not," Goldberg writes, "Cousteau turned the explorer from a man giving answers into a person looking at the world with questions, and then finally looking inward with those questions."</p>
