It's hard not to love [Eliasson's work](http://www.olafureliasson.net/). Deceptively simple, immersive environments are where he shines. Currently up at the [Arken Museum](http://www.arken.dk/content/us) is _Your Blind Passenger_, a 90-meter tunnel, densely fogged. So visibility is minimal, and participants must use other instincts to find their way.

Eliasson says the project "constitutes a possibility that is actualized and converted into reality, an opening where concepts like subject and object, inside and outside, proximity and distance are tossed into the air and redefined."

"Our sense of orientation is challenged and the coordinates of our spaces, collective and personal, have to be renegotiated."
