This fall's version of [Investigating Normal](http://ablersite.org/investigating-normal/) will include several dream collaborators: Lacy Gillotti of [NEADS](http://neads.org/), a service dog training organization, Alex Geller of [Fathom Info](http://fathom.info/), with whom we'll be exploring disability and the school-to-prison pipeline, [Mel Chua](http://melchua.com/), a postdoc at Olin who is deaf, has spent her life "passing" as hearing, and will be getting a cochlear implant this fall, and [Carmen Papalia,](http://blog.art21.org/2014/10/07/you-can-do-it-with-your-eyes-closed/) an artist who's blind and has a complicated relationship to the white cane.

Carmen will be here from September 25-29, doing an artist's "micro-residency," or so we're calling it at Olin. There are events on Friday, September 25 in the Olin Library that are free and open to the public. We'd love to see you there.
