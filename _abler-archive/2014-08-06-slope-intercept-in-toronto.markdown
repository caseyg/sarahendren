### Next Thursday and Friday, August 14 and 15, I'll be back in Toronto with [Interaccess](http://interaccess.org/) and the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](http://idrc.ocad.ca/), to give a lecture and run a workshop and panel based on my ongoing project, [Slope : Intercept](http://slopeintercept.org/). All of it is free and open to the public, held at 49 McCaul Street, so please come! A public lecture is from 4-5 on August 14th, and the workshop and panel runs on the 15th, from 9-12. More details at [Interaccess](http://interaccess.org/blog/2014/jul/waking-machines-assistive-technologies-and-prosthetic-agency).




### The workshop and forum in particular are what I've been planning as the next step in the project—to make my [material design](http://slopeintercept.org/suite-of-5-boston-2013/) become a catalyst for highly localized public discussions about built environments for leisure and access, politics and play, wheeled mobility in multiple senses. Skateboarding and wheelchair use.

### I'm particularly excited about the workshop and panel on Friday, from 9-12 noon. We'll be exploring a set of city blocks in central Toronto and making an alternate map of that part of the city with new eyes: thinking about deliberate, overlooked, and even accidental features of the architecture and landscape that make cities hospitable or hostile to wheeled mobile gear.

### Joining us will be [Ariel Stagni](http://www.wcsk8.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=159:ariel-stagni&catid=25:staff-bios&Itemid=81), Toronto skateboarder, skating advocate, and design & programming advisor for skate spaces; Luke Anderson from the [Stop Gap project](http://stopgapblog.blogspot.com/), an activist wheelchair-ramp design initiative; and others from the Toronto architecture and planning professions. We'll meet at 49 McCaul Street in Toronto at 9, and we'll spend from 9 am - 11 am exploring the city and making a collective alternate map.




### At 11, the discussion becomes a formal panel, with Ariel, Luke, and others talking about the future of Toronto and other cities: whose bodies are welcome, and how, and why?
