<p>Filmmaker Todd Selby profiles <a href="http://christinesunkim.com/">Christine Sun Kim</a>'s performance work. From the description <a href="http://www.nowness.com/day/2011/11/9/1700/todd-selby-x-christine-sun-kim?ecid=soc1269">on the Nowness site</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Deaf from birth, Kim turned to using sound as a medium during an artist residency in Berlin in 2008, and has since developed a practice of lo-fi experimentation that aims to re-appropriate sound by translating it into movement and vision. "It's a lot more interesting to explore a medium that I don't have direct access to and yet has the most direct connection to society at large," says the artist. "Social norms surrounding sound are so deeply ingrained that, in a sense, our identities cannot be complete without it."</p>
