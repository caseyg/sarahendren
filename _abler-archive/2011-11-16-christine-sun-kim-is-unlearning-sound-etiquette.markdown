Filmmaker Todd Selby profiles [Christine Sun Kim](http://christinesunkim.com/)'s performance work. From the description [on the Nowness site](http://www.nowness.com/day/2011/11/9/1700/todd-selby-x-christine-sun-kim?ecid=soc1269):


Deaf from birth, Kim turned to using sound as a medium during an artist residency in Berlin in 2008, and has since developed a practice of lo-fi experimentation that aims to re-appropriate sound by translating it into movement and vision. "It's a lot more interesting to explore a medium that I don't have direct access to and yet has the most direct connection to society at large," says the artist. "Social norms surrounding sound are so deeply ingrained that, in a sense, our identities cannot be complete without it."
