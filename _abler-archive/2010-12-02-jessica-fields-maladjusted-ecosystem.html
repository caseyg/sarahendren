<p><a href="http://www.jessicafield.ca/">Jessica Field</a> creates robotic social systems that play out like opera. This one, <a href="http://www.jessicafield.ca/Maladjusted.html">Maladjusted Ecosystem</a>, has four doomed players: One robot, the light-seeker, is completely absorbed in finding the highest concentration of light possible. It announces its finding of a light source by a sound; that announcement cues a line-drawing robot to make its marks. A line-seeking robot, upon finding the marks made by the drawer, announces its own sound to signal its find; that sound is the sole cue for action by the fourth robot—the light-emitter.</p>

<p>So this set-up could be a closed ecosystem, but the limitations of each player stand in the way of the true improvisation required for dynamic social interplay.</p>
<p>Field has set programming principles for each robot, and the result is a set of characters who cannot adapt—two are constrained by their singular, reductive search for one thing and one thing only (light, or line drawings); the other two are oblivious to the needs of these seekers who depend on them. They can't internalize the data they're receiving, so they can't acknowledge the others.</p>

<p>This piece is so chock-full of metaphors, it's comical. And tragic.</p>
