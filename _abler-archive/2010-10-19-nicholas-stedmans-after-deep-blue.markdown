<p>Nicholas Stedman makes <a href="http://nickstedman.wordpress.com/">Machines for Social Circumstances</a>. This one is <a href="http://facs-newmedia.finearts.yorku.ca/~nsted/adb2.html"><em>After Deep Blue</em></a>, an affective robot designed to respond to—even seem to seek out—human touch.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"ADB is a modular robot designed for tactile interactions with people. It is composed of a chain of prism-shaped robotic modules. Through the modules' coordinated behavior, the robot writhes, wriggles and twists in response to the presence of skin and force.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">"The robot is animated only when actively engaged by a person, otherwise it is at rest. Stroking, rubbing or grasping <em>ADB</em> results in it pushing back, retreating or occasionally grasping onto a body part, depending on the combination of stimulus.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">Inspiration for the project is drawn from Deep Blue, the computer that defeated former world champion Gary Kasparov in the now legendary 1997 chess match. This event marked a tipping point in the public imagination when the suggestion of a machine intelligence became tangible."</p>
