I'll be at NYU next Thursday and Friday, April 11 and 12. Thursday's talk, "[When Prosthetics Speak](http://www.nyu.edu/disability.council/events/spring.2013.html)," is with the NYU Council for the Study of Disabilityâ€”5:30 - 7 in the Payne Room, 4th Floor Pless Hall, 82 Washington Square East.

On Friday, I'll be speaking alongside [Geoffrey Bowker](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gbowker/) in the Media, Culture, and Communication department's [PROGRAM series](http://www.programseries.com/events/values-in-technological-design/). Starts at 6:30 in the Great Room at 19 University Place. Say hello if you're there!
