The [Firefly Upsee](http://www.fireflyfriends.com/) is a walking baby carrier, designed to give the experience of ambulation to children who have motor delays or mobility restrictions. It brings the child upright, anchored closely to a caregiver, while also leaving her hands free to explore and play.

[![Several adults "wear" their young toddlers in the Firely Upsee baby carriers, but inverted: the child is harnessed to an adult's legs and feet and strapped securely via the shoulders to the adult's waist, allowing simultaneous walking for both caregiver and young user.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/54791.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/54791.jpg)

The design is a collaboration between Debby Elnatan, the Israeli mother of a child with cerebral palsy who had solely used a wheelchair to get around, and the [Firefly team](http://www.fireflyfriends.com/) at the Leckey design company. Developed by a collaboration among clinicians, engineers, therapists, and textile experts, the design will come to the market in early April. [There's a free webinar](http://www.fireflyfriends.com/webinar) for professionals in physical therapy fields and others.

It'll be interesting to watch what the user-consensus yields about its uses as a therapeutic tool—how its loadbearing structure affects these young growing bodies with varying degrees of muscle tone and postural challenges.

Perhaps the biggest intervention here is a social, interactive one: So many therapeutic tools for motor skills help a child to "have fun" while working muscles and strengthening stamina, but in isolation. But this tool fundamentally brings children into the eye-to-eye world of their typically-developing peers. The social brain is so foundational to global development, and it's fed in part by reciprocity, touch, and eye contact. The [Firefly Upsee](http://www.fireflyfriends.com/) brings its users into upright space, yes—but into relational space too.
