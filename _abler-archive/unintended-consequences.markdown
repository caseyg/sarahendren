### Poking around online for [a good interview](http://dronecenter.bard.edu/interview-natalie-jeremijenko/) with Natalie Jeremijenko, I came across her unusual deployment of the term "unintended consequences," which is so often associated with negative byproducts. As ever, Jeremijenko alerts us to opportunities:

### **Jeremijenko:** As a rule of thumb, we should think of technology as a profoundly conservative social source. By definition, it is resource intensive. It costs a lot of money and time to build a technology; therefore, technology is built in the interest of those with money and time. Hence so much military influence on our technology.

### The things that work on our side are these unintended consequences, the complex systems that technology is a part of, these techno-social systems that are not controllable or completely comprehensible. So the unintended consequences can be exploited by those of us with fewer resources and a commitment to a participatory democracy.
