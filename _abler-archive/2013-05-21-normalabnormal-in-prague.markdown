Along with a bunch of other artists, [including](http://wendyjacob.net/) [several](http://jennifercrupi.com/work.html) I already admire, my ongoing experimental work, [_Unknown Armature: Body Socks_](http://sarahendren.net/2012/01/03/unknown-armature-body-socks/), and [_Slope: Intercept_](http://slopeintercept.org/) will be on view at [DOX Centre for Contemporary Art](http://www.dox.cz/en/exhibitions/disabled-by-normality) in Prague. Opens tomorrow. I would kill to be there, but I'm not. Prague will have to wait.

The newest sock, above, is a double, made for two users at once. Custom-made for me by [Susan Urban](http://onestopsensoryshop.com/).
