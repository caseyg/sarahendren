Tan Le and the [Emotiv group's](http://www.emotiv.com/index.php) neuroheadset was recently demonstrated at TED; video below, and worth watching! The headset is a customizable device that reads commands via thoughtsâ€”stunning. The end of the video also shows its relevance for wheelchair users. Thanks, [Jennifer Grant](http://jennifercgrant.com/), for the link!
