title: 2012 04 18 What Is Universal Design
type: archive
---

<p>I've been emailing a bunch with <a href="https://blogs.emory.edu/aimihamraie//">Aimi Hamraie</a>, soon to finish her Ph.D. at Emory University. Aimi's researching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design">universal design</a> and disability politics in the built environment, among other things. We have a lot to talk about, and I'm hoping to post a long exchange between us here. It was Aimi's research that pointed me to one particularly striking example of new construction with elegant, considered, universal design: The <a href="http://icord.org/">Blusson Spinal Cord Centre</a> in Vancouver, home to a large interdisciplinary research group called the International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD).</p>

<p>The building houses a <a href="http://icord.org/facilities/">continuous 200 meter ramp</a> with a 5% incline. Every 5 meters is a level "landing" built in. You can see how dynamically this structure was achieved; the architects wanted to obviate the need for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Symbol_of_Access">International Symbol of Access</a>. (You all <a href="http://www.ablersite.org/2011/02/icon-adventures/">know how I feel</a> about that particular icon...)</p>

<p>I'm thinking about ramps quite a lot these days, especially since writing about the subtleties of <a href="http://www.ablersite.org/2011/09/border-town-beyond-ramps-curitiba-brazil/">transportation access</a> in Curitiba, Brazil. I'll be launching a big networked architecture project in the coming weeks. I'll want your feedback. More to come (here and elsewhere).</p>
