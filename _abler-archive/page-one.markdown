No one is more surprised than me that this follow-up story made it to the very first page of the _Boston Globe_ last Saturday. [Here's the full story](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/13/disability-icon-revamped-guerilla-art-project/HZDJAIORZvL68dukN9L0TL/story.html). The [Accessible Icon Project](http://www.accessibleicon.org/) continues to outpace all our expectations for it. In the Wildest Dreams files: it has just been acquired for the permanent collection at MOMA, in the Architecture & Design division.
