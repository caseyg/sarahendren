The Experimental Design and Gaming Environments lab, or [EDGE](http://edgelab.ryerson.ca/) lab, at Ryerson University, works—among other things—on adaptive tech for children with disabilities. Like the [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/) media lab group where I'm taking a course now, EDGE researchers are committed to democratizing materials for maximum customization and replicability. Following the example of the [Adaptive Design Association](http://adaptivedesign.org/) in New York (I'll be posting about them soon!), they're making good use of cardboard and soft circuitry for all kinds of low-cost tools. [Torontoist](http://torontoist.com/2011/10/edge-lab-democratizes-accessible-design/) has a profile post:


From low-cost wearable garments for speech-impaired children—featuring squeezable buttons that talk—to discreet chair-top self-rocking devices for kids with autism, Nolan and company hope to see their low-cost, DIY designs spread.




"We hope everyone keeps sharing these ideas and continues to improve them with their own innovations," says Kenneally. "It's an exciting experiment in democracy!"

A customized chair for Zoe, who can use it to sit upright without adult or medical assistance.

Soft buttons that squeak when squeezed; a possible first iteration for wearable communication.
