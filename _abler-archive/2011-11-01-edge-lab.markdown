<p>The Experimental Design and Gaming Environments lab, or <a href="http://edgelab.ryerson.ca/">EDGE</a> lab, at Ryerson University, works—among other things—on adaptive tech for children with disabilities. Like the <a href="http://hlt.media.mit.edu/">High-Low Tech</a> media lab group where I'm taking a course now, EDGE researchers are committed to democratizing materials for maximum customization and replicability. Following the example of the <a href="http://adaptivedesign.org/">Adaptive Design Association</a> in New York (I'll be posting about them soon!), they're making good use of cardboard and soft circuitry for all kinds of low-cost tools. <a href="http://torontoist.com/2011/10/edge-lab-democratizes-accessible-design/">Torontoist</a> has a profile post:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">From low-cost wearable garments for speech-impaired children—featuring squeezable buttons that talk—to discreet chair-top self-rocking devices for kids with autism, Nolan and company hope to see their low-cost, DIY designs spread.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"We hope everyone keeps sharing these ideas and continues to improve them with their own innovations," says Kenneally. "It's an exciting experiment in democracy!"</p>
