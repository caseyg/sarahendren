I'm at a conference on [aging and design](http://www.iftf.org/future-now/article-detail/living-longer-aging-well-agingforward/), hosted by the Institute For the Future's Health Horizons research group. It's just beginning, but I already have a favorite project I hadn't seen before: [Speaking Exchange](http://cna.com.br/speakingexchange/), a simple social arrangement between high school students in Brazil, who want to learn English, and older adults in Chicago retirement communities who are happy for this socially engaging labor. The exchange just requires a basic video call application and teacher oversight.

So many technologies for aging that make the news focus on biomedical health: apps to promote exercise and good eating habits, social robots for rehabilitative care. But many adults in the US name [social isolation](http://www.agingcare.com/Articles/loneliness-in-the-elderly-151549.htm) as a big part of their experience in later life, and it affects not only their qualititative wellbeing, but also their risk factors for physical health problems. [Speaking Exchange](http://cna.com.br/speakingexchange/) is an elegant way to match the existing knowledge base of these elders with eager partners across the world, and across generation gaps.
