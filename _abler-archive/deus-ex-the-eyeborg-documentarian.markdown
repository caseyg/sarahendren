Remember [this guy](http://www.eyeborgblog.com/)? I mentioned Rob Spence in [this post](http://www.ablersite.org/2011/03/whats-wrong-with-prosthetics-porn-part-ii/) a while back; he's now working on several film projects around his own and others' prosthetic gear. Lots to think about here, in the ways he frames the possibilities and discussion.
