<p>Montreal's <a href="http://www.mariechouinard.com/flash.html">Compagnie Marie Chouinard</a>'s 2005 work, bODY_rEMIX/ gOLDBERG_vARIATIONS employs ten dancers who</p>
<p>"execute variations on the exercise of freedom. Often, the dancers appear on points: on one, two, and even four at a time. In a spectroscopy of the gesture, we also see them using different devices "“ crutches, rope, prostheses, horizontal bars, and harnesses "“ which at times liberate their movements, at others fetter it, and at still others create it." You can see a video of the work on the company site.</p>
