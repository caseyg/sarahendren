Dana Gordon and Alejandro Zamudio SÃ¡nchez's ["Itch" chair](http://www.dana-gordon.com/blog/itch/) connects your hand's movements—on a surface under the seat—to the direction and intensity of a small scratcher, perfectly positioned for the sitter's back:


Scratch underneath this four-legged friend and feel how the motion is mapped and scaled up to your own back. This futuristic contraption comes equipped with a broad selection of "fingernails" that can be attached to the itch-calming mechanism to satisfy virtually every kind of scratching known to man. Or woman.
