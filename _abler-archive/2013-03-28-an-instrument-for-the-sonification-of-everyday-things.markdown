You might think of this project as a poetics of [sensory substitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_substitution): swapping one capacity for another. There are a number of tools in development now that translate [visual material into audible "colors,](http://www.seeingwithsound.com/)" or [use tactile signals to "see" the environment](http://www.wicab.com/en_us/)—they create an artificial form of synaesthesia that's meant to compensate for lost function in one or another bodily sense.

Dennis Paul's [Instrument for the Sonification of Everyday Things](http://dennisppaul.de/an-instrument-for-the-sonification-of-everday-things/) externalizes the shape of multiple objects—in sound waves.  Like a morphological record player:

[![A crumpled piece of newspaper is sandwiched and suspended between two tabletop "vice grip" structures, capable of spinning the object laterally, like a rotisserie. A small squarish tool below the paper scans its surfaces and translates them into sounds.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/smr-002.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/smr-002.jpg)
