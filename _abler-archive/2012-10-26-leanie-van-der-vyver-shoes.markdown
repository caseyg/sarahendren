I'm always interested in prosthetics that create slowness, as opposed to speed; disruption, as opposed to efficiency. Like Sitraka Rakotoniaina and Harry Vermeulen’s [_Time Conditioning_](http://ablersite.org/2012/01/19/see-yourself-sensing/) piece, or Jessica Field's [_Maladjusted Ecosystem_](http://ablersite.org/2010/12/02/jessica-fields-maladjusted-ecosystem/). So I also love these shoes by [Leanie van der Vyver](http://cargocollective.com/Leanie):

[![close up shot of a woman in leather "heels." The shoes have the higher heel in front, braced by the front of the calf, so the wearer must bend at an awkward angle to wear them.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dezeen_scary-beautiful-by-leanie-van-de-vyver_1.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dezeen_scary-beautiful-by-leanie-van-de-vyver_1.jpg)

Watch the video to see how they comment so pointedly on the sky-high hobbled walk imposed by heels—in this case inverted entirely. (You'll have to click through to Vimeo; they've made it impossible to embed it here.)
