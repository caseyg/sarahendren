<p>Rhizome just alerted me to <a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jun/27/chisenhale-gallery/">Amalia Pica's show</a> at <a href="http://www.chisenhale.org.uk/">Chisenhale Gallery</a>:</p>

<p>Kari Rittenbach writes that "the scale of the hearing device explodes for <em>Acoustic Radar in Cardboard </em>(2012), a crude gramophone-like form with a bell wide enough [that appears to] to catch conversations floating nearby."</p>

<p>And together with this piece, <em>Switchboard</em> (2012), which "plays into childhood notions of telecommunications: the direct line traveling window to window, held taut enough across the block to carry urgent vibrations of the voice," Rittenbach writes, "her body of work forms a critique of the individual’s pure egoism as much as particular barriers to communication (chance, timing, autocracy) – playing with language, symbol and signal to 'talk about talking.'"</p>
