German CGI design firm [Viaframe](http://www.viaframe.de/en/portfolio1/armor1.html) imagined these [sets of armature](http://www.viaframe.de/en/portfolio1/armor1.html) for a body's fleshy inner parts. A solid casement for your heart, lungs, or brain.

They conform to the shapes of the organs precisely, showing their enigmatic structures, isolating their particular functions.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/giz2012-05-29_herz_ruestung_900px.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/giz2012-05-29_herz_ruestung_900px.jpg)

They're an interesting thought-experiment around what's happening, research-wise, at the cellular and molecular level. How do you protect an organ system? What makes it robust and thriving, instead of susceptible to disease?

And what relationships, if any, are there between these kinds of speculations and the current models for replacement limbs that _do_ exist? Perhaps it's utter fantasy, but these caught my eye as a thinking-through-images.
