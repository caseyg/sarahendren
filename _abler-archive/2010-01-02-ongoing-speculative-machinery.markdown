I'm looking for collaborators to propose new tools—speculative machines—that invert or transform or exaggerate an adaptive aid that already exists.

If you currently use some piece of equipment—hearing aid, wheelchair, anything—and have a machine you'd like to dream up, contact me (sara at sarahendren dot com). I'm interested in designing machines that reveal something about human experience that's unexpected: what it's like to use the aid that might currently be invisible, how a similar aid for an able-bodied person would serve some other purpose, some imagined tool that has yet to appear.

Here's a first design: a posterior walker for mobility or stability help. This model is of clear lucite, making its user more visible than the tool. It has detachable tandem grips on the back, for sharing the experience, and it's got sensitive grips on the main body, connected to a LED display. The display would monitor the relative effort and energy required to maintain normal balance and propel oneself forward—measures, in other words, that suggest things about relative dependence _and_ independence.
