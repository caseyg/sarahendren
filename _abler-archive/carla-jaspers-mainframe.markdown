[Carla Jaspers](http://www.carlajaspers.com/) is a New York-based designer trained both in occupational therapy and industrial design, and possibly the first person to properly rant about the ridiculousness of walkers-with-tennis-balls:

[![a commonly used walker mobility aid, with wheels on front and tennis balls on the back two feet](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/walker_elderly_tennis_balls.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/walker_elderly_tennis_balls.jpg)

Jaspers raises this medicalized, ill-conceived structure as evidence that assistive tech remains utterly marginalized from the mainstream design field. She [writes](http://carlamj.blogspot.com/2011/10/design-fail.html) that our cultural acceptance of this "adaptation" has been so complete that, rather than a re-imagining of the entire apparatus, there are braces designed to hold the tennis balls in place:

[![two tennis balls on walker legs, with a specially-designed attachment to hold the balls onto the leg, despite their ill fit as an adaptation.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tennisballattachment.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tennisballattachment.jpg)

So I love how Carla completely took this task apart, finding similarities in the walking gait and the task at hand with other common needs:

[![Three images show similar movements among gear-users in cities: a walker, a woman pushing a stroller, and a woman pushing a wire-frame grocery cart. All three must bend over their tools in a similar fashion.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/home.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/home.jpg)

[![A drawing with 2 dozen or so sketches and images of wheeled gear, with directional red lines indicating their axes of movement. Bikes, strollers and all forms of walker prototypes.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/sketch-development2.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/sketch-development2.jpg)

And landed finally on this "[Mainframe](http://www.carlajaspers.com/mainframe)" design, equally a mobility aid and hauling device for gear—you can hang bags, for instance, on the cross bars—or a provisional stroller.

[![A triptych of Jaspers's final prototype, both collapsed in a fold and fully open. It has a streamlined elegance, with a pale frame, tan handle grips, and a smart set of four wheels](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mainframe_triptych.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mainframe_triptych.jpg)
