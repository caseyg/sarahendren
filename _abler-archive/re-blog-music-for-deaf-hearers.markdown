This collar by German designer [Frederik Podzuweit](http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_details.asp?job_seeker_id=330755&t=&specialty=4&&page_no=&c=1) creates music for deaf people—through skin vibration. Apparently the transmission of electricity through the device to the neck, collarbone and shoulders creates a very rich experience of music—triggering the same parts of the brain, adapted for those who don't hear with their ears—as those used for normative aural experience.

[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5551754/how-a-collar-could-help-deaf-people-hear-music) writes that "it's even possible, in certain cases, that deaf people experience music more powerfully because they _can't_ hear; as Oliver Sacks tells it in [_Musicophilia_](http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/1400040817/mockerybird/?ref=nosim&tag=gmgamzn-20), the auditory cortex might become extra-sensitive when hearing slips."
