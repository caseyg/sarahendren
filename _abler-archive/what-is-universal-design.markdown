I've been emailing a bunch with [Aimi Hamraie](https://blogs.emory.edu/aimihamraie//), soon to finish her Ph.D. at Emory University. Aimi's researching [universal design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) and disability politics in the built environment, among other things. We have a lot to talk about, and I'm hoping to post a long exchange between us here. It was Aimi's research that pointed me to one particularly striking example of new construction with elegant, considered, universal design: The [Blusson Spinal Cord Centre](http://icord.org/) in Vancouver, home to a large interdisciplinary research group called the International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD).

The building houses a [continuous 200 meter ramp](http://icord.org/facilities/) with a 5% incline. Every 5 meters is a level "landing" built in. You can see how dynamically this structure was achieved; the architects wanted to obviate the need for the [International Symbol of Access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Symbol_of_Access). (You all [know how I feel](http://www.ablersite.org/2011/02/icon-adventures/) about that particular icon...)

I'm thinking about ramps quite a lot these days, especially since writing about the subtleties of [transportation access](http://www.ablersite.org/2011/09/border-town-beyond-ramps-curitiba-brazil/) in Curitiba, Brazil. I'll be launching a big networked architecture project in the coming weeks. I'll want your feedback. More to come (here and elsewhere).
