Ana Rajcevic's collection, [ANIMAL: The Other Side of Evolution](http://www.anarajcevic.com/animal/studio/), proposes a set of wearables that explore "animal anatomy, building upon existing skeleton structures to create a series of sculptural pieces that appear as natural properties of the human body."

[![A woman wears a piece of "chin jewelry": a bone-white form that grasps her jaw and has a long horn-like protrusion from the chin.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/31_ana-rajcevic-animal-02.jpg)](http://ablersite.org/2012/12/19/ana-rajcevics-other-side-of-evolution/31_ana-rajcevic-animal-02/#main)

[![Another horn-like protrusion from a jaw-wrapping sculpture, with the horn from the chin circling back up in front the face, ending at the crown of the head.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/31_ana-rajcevic-animal-03.jpg)](http://ablersite.org/2012/12/19/ana-rajcevics-other-side-of-evolution/31_ana-rajcevic-animal-03/#main)

[![Part hat, part sculpture. A woman wears an adornment that perches at the bridge of the nose and wraps up and around the head like a horn, ending in a narrow tail at the back of the skull.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/31_ana-rajcevic-animal-06.jpg)](http://ablersite.org/2012/12/19/ana-rajcevics-other-side-of-evolution/31_ana-rajcevic-animal-06/#main)

Made of gelcoat, fiberglass, resin and silicone rubber, the suite of works form "a collection of 8 pieces of personal adornment that would not be specifically categorised as jewellery or accessories. The idea was to step out of the traditional jewellery/accessories context in order to develop a ‘new breed’ of precious objects that can be exhibited both separately on their own and fully attached to the human body."
