[![A graffitied wall reaing "Tempt"in pinks, reds, and bluesâ€” the name of the graffiti artist who is the subject of the film.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/gettingup-lores.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/gettingup-lores.jpg)

Tomorrow night, I'll be a panelist for a screening and discussion of [Getting Up](http://boston.reelabilities.org/films/view/getting-up), one of the films being shown at the [ReelAbilities festival](http://boston.reelabilities.org/films) here in Boston. The film covers the story of Tempt One, a graffiti artist in LA who is diagnosed with ALS; he goes on to co-develop [The Eyewriter](http://www.eyewriter.org/) technology. This project has gotten lots of press; it's great to see the film walk us through the whole story of Tempt himself, how many collaborators joined this projects, their trial-and-error process, and the community of Tempt's family and friends along the way. [Details here](http://boston.reelabilities.org/films/view/getting-up), and below is the trailer:
