Matthias Gommel's <a href="http://www.gommel.com/"><em>Delayed</em></a> places two participants in conversation via headsetsâ€“except their communications are postponed for five seconds. No instructions are given when you encounter this work; it's a game of trials and tests and repeats. It's striking to me that this piece originates from 2002, precisely when it would have registered most strongly around the can-you-hear-me-now ubiquity of mobile phones and their attendant stuttering rhythms. In one way, it's a work located in that exact year. But in the museum context, like <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/exhib_events/exhibitions/306">this show at SFMOMA</a> from 2009, they become an additional performance as well.</p>
