Yoony Byun's prosthetic leg concept repurposes sneaker parts, making a user-adjustable, low-cost limb:

Byun had in mind the common injuries that happen in landmine encounters—lower leg amputations sustained in parts of the world where landmines can linger, hidden, indefinitely. (78% of landmine injuries in Cambodia, for instance, are this "transtibial" kind.)

Byun's model uses both the shoe's sewn upper for its knee brace and the hard rubber treads for its foot—a simple design made to accommodate wet labor conditions without damage.
