[Cohen Van Balen](http://www.cohenvanbalen.com/) is a design partnership I've been admiring for some time. I'm only now posting one of their projects here—The [Phantom Recorder](http://www.cohenvanbalen.com/work/phantom-recorder) :

"The Phantom Recorder system projects a cold and damp sensation onto the skin surface, triggering the brain to hallucinate a phantom. As the phantom movement stimulates the peripheral nerves, its activity is captured by the neural implant and external wireless machinery."

"A novel peripheral nerve interface allows regenerating axons to grow into microchannels, incorporating embedded electrodes. This neural implant enables sensations to be inserted to the device, or for activity to be recorded from movements. Could we use this technology to record illusions of the mind? What if our imagination could be captured through our nerves?"
