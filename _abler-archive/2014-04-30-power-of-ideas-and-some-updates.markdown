I'm happy to be included in the May issue of Boston Magazine, themed around the [Power of Ideas](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/04/29/power-of-ideas/).

I've also had some great talks with various assistive tech journalists for stories and podcasts lately. They include a podcast interview for the [Assistive Technology Update](http://www.eastersealstech.com/2014/02/21/atu143-sarah-hendren-abler-and-gizmodo-minimum-wage-for-people-with-disabilities-switching-from-mac-back-to-windows-csun-pre-conference-workshops-zoomtext-mac-update-app-drafts/), produced by the INDATA project, and a radio conversation with the [Out of Step Tool group](http://www.outofstep.com/toost-radio/riveting/riveting-5-sara-hendren/), an economic services group for people with disabilities.

I've had some great exchanges with journalists for the Atlantic Tech channel in the last month. I'll do a separate post with excerpts from those.
