<p>Alex Dodge's new <a href="http://www.alexdodge.com/index.php">Generative</a> series was recently on display at Brooklyn's <a href="http://www.klausgallery.com/exhibitions/2010/alex-dodge/">Klaus von Nichtssagend Gallery</a>. Featured are works like the Sleep Talker, an experimental prototype for social networking in your sleepâ€”connecting users via "dream feeds."</p>

<p>"When the software detects synchronous or compatible dream sleep, it attempts to pair [it] with either a predesignated user over the internet or automatically to an available user within the Sleep Talker social network. In group mode, multiple users can form dream clusters defined by specific criteria, or a single user can designate their feed as 'broadcast-only' for others to listen to."</p>
