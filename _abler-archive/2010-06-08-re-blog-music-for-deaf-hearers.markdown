<p>This collar by German designer <a href="http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_details.asp?job_seeker_id=330755&amp;t=&amp;specialty=4&amp;&amp;page_no=&amp;c=1">Frederik Podzuweit</a> creates music for deaf people—through skin vibration. Apparently the transmission of electricity through the device to the neck, collarbone and shoulders creates a very rich experience of music—triggering the same parts of the brain, adapted for those who don't hear with their ears—as those used for normative aural experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5551754/how-a-collar-could-help-deaf-people-hear-music">Gizmodo</a> writes that "it's even possible, in certain cases, that deaf people experience music more powerfully because they <em>can't</em> hear; as Oliver Sacks tells it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/1400040817/mockerybird/?ref=nosim&amp;tag=gmgamzn-20" target="_blank"><em>Musicophilia</em></a>, the auditory cortex might become extra-sensitive when hearing slips."</p>
