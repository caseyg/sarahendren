### The [Exoskel Urban Climber](http://www.tactical-life.com/gear/exoskel-urban-climber-x2-shin-guards-new-product/) caught my eye, via [@bldgblog](https://twitter.com/bldgblog). It's another story in military/defense gear that has all kinds of potential prosthetic applicationsâ€”a strap-on set of shin guards that have 4 horizontal rows of big "teeth" across the front of the lower leg, allowing the user to grasp and brace against edges or rough surfaces.

### It's interesting that the general biomimicry of the exoskeletal in the animal kingdom is everywhere the last few years.

### I'm thinking about [Ekso Bionics](http://www.eksobionics.com/), these 3D printed "[Magic Arms](http://ablersite.org/2012/08/02/magic-arms/)," and even this [exo-necklace](http://ablersite.org/2012/12/03/the-exo/). More on the urban climber at places like [Soldier Systems](http://soldiersystems.net/2014/04/07/exoskel/).
