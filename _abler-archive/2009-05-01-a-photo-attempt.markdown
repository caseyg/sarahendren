<p>Representing disability is a challenge; representing cognitive or developmental disability may be more so. Here's an image from a series of bulletin boards, created in late 2007 by the <a href="http://www.aboutourkids.org/">NYU Child Study Center</a>. Designed as ransom notes, they were created as a public awareness campaign about various childhood neurological conditions, including the autism spectrum.</p>
<p>But the dramatic presentation, and the perceived negativity in their description of these conditions, backfired immediately. The outcry from autism advocacy groups was swift and loud; the conflict was sufficient to produce articles in the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. The boards were pulled in less than three weeks of their debut. <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/">Here's</a> a chronicle of the entire debacle.</p>

We will make sure he will not be able to care for himself or interact socially as long as he lives. This is ony the beginning.&quot; signed Autism" width="360" height="233" /></a></p>
<p>I keep thinking about how one <em>would</em> create an awareness campaign that more people would get behind. My friend Jennifer Olson, an L.A. museum educator, and I are working on a proposal for a curatorial project: to collect existing images of disability from all over the world, and to commission new images that better represent self-advocates and their own ideas about disablednessâ€”what it is, and what it isn't.</p>
<p>We'd ultimately like to build a collection that would go to the <a href="http://www.politicalgraphics.org/home.html">Center for the Study of Political Graphics</a>, also in Los Angeles, for future study and use. Email me if you come across suitable images!</p>
