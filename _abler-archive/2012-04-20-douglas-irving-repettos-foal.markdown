Douglas Irving Repetto's ["foal" project](http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/portfolio/foal/) has been one of my favorites for years. Not sure why it took me so long to post it here. It's a simple walking tableâ€”a piece of furniture that weirdly, animatedly, mimics the first tentative steps of a gangly animal.

Repetto has taught people to make these creatures at workshops. Pictures below from a workshop at MOMA; you can read more about its appearance at various venues [here](http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/portfolio/foal/).
