Please do get in touch! I'd love to hear from you. With a book to write, an evolving job, and three young children, I'm not very available for meetups and conversations. But I do (still) love email and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ablerism), and, if you like, I'll send you occasional news via Tinyletter. Sign up is [here](https://tinyletter.com/sarahendren).

Speaking requests go through Kate Berner (kberner@penguinrandomhouse.com) at [Penguin Random House Speakers Bureau](https://www.prhspeakers.com/about-us). Media inquiries go through Shailyn Tavella at Riverhead (stavella@penguinrandomhouse.com).
