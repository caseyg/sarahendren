It's a time for speaking out: for dismantling and rebuilding alike. 2020 is full of both critique and repair, in the rhetorical sense—and beyond, of course, but let's stick with the rhetorical for a minute. 

In my country, the urgent vibrancy of critique has been born of COVID calamity of every kind, and born of a new spotlight on an enduring pattern of unspeakable violence against black folks. We're seeing critique in the public sphere: criticism of leadership, of the weaknesses in our infrastructural systems, of our cultural confusion about acting in any sense collectively. Critique is alive and well (thank goodness!). What are its modes of action? Critique **unmasks** hidden or suppressed realities. It **reveals** ugly truths. It **subverts** or even **negates** mainstream or inherited or lazy narratives. We're seeing its vivid power in every variety: in words and images, in books and popular culture, and naturally, on social media. It's a beautiful (and alternately wrenching, and always vital) thing to witness.

We're also seeing rhetorical acts of repair: proposals for new worlds that might be prototyped anew in the wake of disaster. There are calls for new models of business and medicine and education, newly flexible work structures, new forms of architecture and urban planning, new services for community safety. The longer work of these reparative ideas has yet to be tested, but if we stay with just the rhetorical—these first acts of naming and calling for repair—we can identify its complementary modes of action. Repair language **suggests** new futures. It **invites** possibility. Perhaps it **translates** ideas from the past that might be reinvigorated, or perhaps it **enchants** by asking: what if?  

I'm interested in both critique and repair language (and in deeds, always), and I'm interested in more people getting clearer about which post they tend to occupy. Both are necessary, and neither is sufficient to the work of social change alone. Our inner disposition usually tends this way or that—and of course, it's all too easy to make our post—the modes of critique or the modes of repair—into the only post, or the more correct or righteous post. Or to cast doubt on the authenticity of the other. 

But understanding each mode **as a post**—a vantage with particular assets and with unavoidable drawbacks—is the way to sidestep the ordinary debates about "civility" that tend to get explosive in urgent times.
