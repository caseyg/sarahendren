I gave a talk last year at the Eyeo Festival about (among other things) finding new names for describing design. Quoted Rory Hyde in this talk last year, but I hadn't at that time come across Michael Rock's extended writing on this topic too: [designer as translator, performer, or director](https://2x4.org/ideas/22/designer-as-author/). Rock addresses the tension inherent in seeking an intentional definition of designerâ€”namely, rejecting the supposed neutrality of the designer as "mere facilitator," the invisibility fetish, but also avoiding the pitfalls of becoming the auteur, the singular genius.

I like his ending:

"*If we really need to coin a phrase to describe an activity encompassing imaging, editing, narration, chronicling, performing, translating, organizing and directing, I'll conclude with a suggestion:

designer = designer*."
