Leslie Jamison has one of many essays in the new collection on writers and money, [Scratch: Writers, Money, and the Art of Making a Living](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Scratch/Manjula-Martin/9781501134579). It's a good one in the collection, and it's this quote from Raymond Carver that I'm still thinking about:

"I remember thinking at that moment, amid the feelings of helpless frustration that had me close to tears, that nothing—and brother, I mean nothing—that ever happened to me on this earth could come anywhere close, could possibly be as important to me, could make as much difference, as the fact that I had two children. And that I would always have them and always find myself in this position of unrelieved responsibility and permanent distraction.

I'm talking about real influence now. I'm talking about the moon and the tide."
