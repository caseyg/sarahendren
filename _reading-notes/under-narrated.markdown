The last couple of years have been a busy season for weddings in my immediate circles. These seasons come and go, and I'm always thrilled when they come back around. Nothing else can move me so much as two people declaring such staggeringly uninformed promises to one another in front of people who love them, their wild optimism laid bare for a few open hours. What could be more impractical?

This month I'll cross a threshold in my own marriage: I'll have lived half of my life with Brian, and I'll start a period where I'll have shared life with him for longer than I had without. I'm not that old, so people find this to be understandably curious, even strange, and it's admittedly hard to sum up the meaning and import of lengthy partnership. I often quote George Saunders in this (ridiculously charming, vintage GS) [gchat interview in the Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/12/23/gchatting-with-george-saunders/), where he mentions having been married to his wife at that point for 25 yearsâ€”and casually saying that it's "one of the great under-narrated pleasures of living: long-term fidelity and love."

Under-narrated indeed. And it's easy to see why: not that all happy families are alike, but that the stuff of narrative is so often productively made up of ruptures and cracks, interruptions in the status quo so as to construct plot, conflict, creative heat-and-energy. But I'm always on the lookout for descriptions of the macro- and micro-descriptions of what it means to know someone for years and years and years. Descriptions that try and approximate the mystery that you can be joined in such a way that's nearly cellular and become, in the course of that, more powerfully and individually your separate self. It's an experience that invites hopeless abstractions and platitudes. So I don't end up talking about it much.

Mohsin Hamid's [Exit West](http://shop.harvard.com/book/9780735212176) isn't about long-term fidelity and love, but there are passages where Hamid hints at the vicissitudes of a relationship and ponders the ways long attachments proceed outside of ordinary time. The whole book is full of so many aside observations that are worth reading, but I'm thinking today about this passage.
