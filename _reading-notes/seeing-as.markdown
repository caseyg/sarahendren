Michael Berube's book, Life As We Know It, was an absolute lifesaver for me after my eldest son, Graham, was born with Down syndrome in 2006. I was looking in vain for any story that would tell mine back to me. What did it mean to be ushered into this particular set of the human family with whom I felt so little affinity, at least at that time? The literary world is full of the most drippy purple prose about developmental disability, and perhaps especially about Down syndrome. So little of it was of any use; my husband and I weren't looking for rosy redemption stories about "angelic," "always happy" people like, we were told, "they always are." We had no need of a *they*, but we did need a sense that we, all of us, were part of something biggerâ€”a much more profound historical invitation that would affect how we lived but also attach us to a discourse and a politics that came before our family and would proceed after us. Berube's book was that. It's astonishing in its lucid oscillation between the tiniest details and the most dense theoretical power, all told with Berube's singular, casual prose. 

I won't be writing much about my own story in my book. There are now scores of disability parenting memoirs out there, and I'm not interested in unpacking our own story so much. To be sure, as I trace the origins of design and disability and the lessons they pack for an inclusive future, I'll certainly be re-examining Berube's book in part for its continual nourishment when I'm worried about Graham and his future. But mostly I'll read it for craft.

"Lamost as a form of emotional exercise, I have tried, on occasion, to step back and see [my son Jamie, born with Down syndrome] as others might see him, as an instance of a category, one item on the long list of human subgroups. *This is a child with Down syndrome,* I say to myself. *This is a child with a developmental disability.*
