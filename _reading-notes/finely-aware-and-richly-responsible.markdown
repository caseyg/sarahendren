Lynn Hunt on the novel's morality. Order her book and also read the Nussbaum. Also grab Hunt from Innovation Hub on Jefferson and the idea of democracy preceding its actuality. This may be a separate post, but it's connected to Wesley Hill's citing his graduation speaker to "proclaim great things and nurture tiny ones." It all feels connected right now but again may be separable into two.

Also thinking of Ellie's graduation speech and the bitterness there, on rejecting the "change the world" message given to her generation, as a forced-entry approach to the waiting planet. Instead she wants to nurture the tiniest things. There's room for both. Proclamation gives us words to live byâ€”a forever aspiration as our intellectual and spiritual nutrition.
