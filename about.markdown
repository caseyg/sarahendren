Sara's recent work includes collaborative public art and social design that engages the human body, technology, and the politics of disability. She frequently writes and lectures on prosthetics, disability studies, hybrid art-engineering practices, critical design, and related topics. Her work has been exhibited in the US and abroad and is held in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art (NYC) and the Cooper Hewitt Museum. Her first book, on the unexpected places where disability is at the heart of design in everyday objects and environments, is forthcoming from [Riverhead Books](http://www.penguin.com/meet/publishers/riverhead/?ref=2B4575AB81AF). She is an Eric & Wendy Schmidt Fellow at [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/fellows/current-roster/) and the recipient of a 2017 Public Scholar grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. In spring 2018, she is a [Logan Nonfiction Fellow]((http://careyinstitute.org/nonfiction/logan-nonfiction-program-welcomes-spring-2018-fellows-carey-institute/)) at the Carey Institute for Global Good. At [Olin](http://www.olin.edu/), she is also the Principal Investigator on a three-year initiative to bring more arts experiences to engineering students and faculty, funded by the Mellon Foundation. Sara lives in Cambridge, Mass., with her husband and three children.
