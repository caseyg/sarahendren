Sara Hendren is an artist, design researcher, writer, and professor at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu). She is the author of [What Can A Body Do? How We Meet the Built World](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/561049/what-can-a-body-do-by-sara-hendren/), forthcoming from Penguin Random House in August 2020. Her [lab](http://aplusa.org/) and [projects](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/#project) include collaborative
public art and social design that engages
the human body, technology, and the politics of disability â€” things like [a lectern for short stature](http://aplusa.org/projects/alterpodium-amanda-cachia/) or a [ramp for wheelchair dancing](http://aplusa.org/projects/ramp-alice-sheppard/). She also co-founded the [Accessible Icon Project](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/accessible-icon-project/), co-created [a digital archive of low-tech prosthetics](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/engineering-at-home/), and has a long-running obsession [with the inclined plane](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/slope-intercept/).




Sara's work has been exhibited at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art, The Vitra Design Museum, the Seoul Museum of Art and other venues and is held in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art  and the Cooper Hewitt Museum. At Olin, she
is also the Principal Investigator on [a
three-year initiative](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/) to bring more arts experiences to engineering students and
faculty, supported by the Mellon Foundation.
