Sara Hendren is an artist, design researcher, writer, and professor at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu). Her [lab](http://aplusa.org/) and [projects](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/) include collaborative
public art and social design that engages
the human body, technology, and the politics of disabilityâ€”things like [a lectern for short stature](http://aplusa.org/projects/alterpodium-amanda-cachia/) or a [ramp for wheelchair dancing](http://aplusa.org/projects/ramp-alice-sheppard/). She also co-founded the [Accessible Icon Project](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/accessible-icon-project/), co-created [a digital archive of low-tech prosthetics](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/engineering-at-home/), and has a long-running obsession [with the inclined plane](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/slope-intercept/). She frequently
[writes and lectures](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/) on prosthetics,
disability studies, hybrid art-engineering practices, critical design, and related ideas.




Her work has been exhibited at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art, The Vitra Design Museum, the Seoul Museum of Art and other venues and is held in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art  and the Cooper Hewitt Museum. Her [first book](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/first-book/), on the unexpected places where disability is at the heart of design in everyday
objects and environments, is forthcoming from Riverhead/Pengiun Random House. She has been an [Eric & Wendy Schmidt Fellow](https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/sara-hendren/) at New America, a [Logan Nonfiction Fellow](https://careyinstitute.org/index/sara-hendren/) at the Carey Institute for Global Good, and

is also the Principal Investigator on [a
three-year initiative](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/) to bring more arts experiences to engineering students and
faculty, supported by the Mellon Foundation.
