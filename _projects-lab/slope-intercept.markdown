[Slope : Intercept](http://slopeintercept.org/), begun in 2013 with a set of five modular ramps for use by skateboarders and wheelchair users, is an extended art and design research project organized around the inclined plane. Read the project's [web site](http://slopeintercept.org/) for a discussion of the inclined plane in history,  its first uses as speculative and critical design, and its growth as a provocation for events in Toronto, Seoul, and with dancer and choreographer [Alice Sheppard](https://kineticlight.org/).
