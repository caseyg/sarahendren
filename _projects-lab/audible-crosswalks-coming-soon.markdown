Crosswalk signal sounds are infrastructure *and* culture. They sound like [beeps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjAq9tPaNLg) or [chirps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpE5-x6u500) or [drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSNYmcbsnQw), depending on the city or town; there are even signals that are to the tune of [folk songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-7k2y-mXAw) in Japan. They are everyday wayfinding design and unusual bits of the hyperlocal soundscape.

I'm working on a sound installation that is comprised of these signals, and I've got exhibitions in Chicago and San Francisco in the next year where this work will be experienced. It's still very much under construction, but I'm hoping to create an encounter with these sounds that defamiliarizes them enough to hear them with new ears and also ground their pragmatic use in the experience of pedestrians who use other senses than vision for their street navigation. So I'm looking for a couple of kinds of data. I need as many copies of sound files as I can get, from as many different global sources as possible. And I need to hear from people who use the audible signals—people who are blind or who have low vision—so I've set up a quick survey form
