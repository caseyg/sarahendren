Crosswalk signal sounds are both infrastructure and culture. They sound like [beeps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjAq9tPaNLg) or [chirps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpE5-x6u500) or [drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSNYmcbsnQw), depending on the city or town; there are even signals that are to the tune of [folk songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-7k2y-mXAw) in Japan. They are everyday wayfinding infrastructure and unusual bits of the hyperlocal soundscape.

I designed a sound installation that is comprised of a mix of these signals, and the piece was shown at Adds Donna in Chicago and at SOMArts in San Francisco. It's designed to 1) create an encounter with these sounds that defamiliarizes them enough to hear them with new ears and 2) to ground their pragmatic use in the experience of pedestrians who use senses other than vision for their street navigation.
