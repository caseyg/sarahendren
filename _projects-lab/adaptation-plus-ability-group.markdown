The Adaptation + Ability Group is a technical and social lab for creative engineering and design on the subjects of disability. I direct the lab, but it runs on an occasional and as-needed basis, with student teams and outside collaborators as opportunities arise. Our projects have included: a ramp for wheelchair dancing, a lectern for short stature, a sonic white-cane instrument, low-tech prosthetics, and more.
