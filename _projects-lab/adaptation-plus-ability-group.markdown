The [Adaptation \+ Ability Group at Olin College](http://aplusa.org) is a technical and social lab for engineering, design, and disability. I direct the lab, but all the work is collaborative, much of it student-driven. You can see projects [there](http://aplusa.org): a ramp for wheelchair dancing, a podium for short stature, a sonic white-cane instrument, low-tech prosthetics, and more.
