  – Translators, impresarios, believers, and the heartbroken—this is a talk about
  design outside of authorship and ownership, IP or copyright, and even outside of
  research and collaboration. When and where do ideas come to life? What counts as
  design? Sara talks about some of her own "not a real designer" work, but mostly
  she talks about the creative work of others: in marine biology, architecture, politics,
  education. Lots of nerdy history, folks.'
