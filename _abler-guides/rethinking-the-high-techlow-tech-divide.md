Conversations about prosthetics still tend to assume that complicat-ed and next-generation technologies must, by definition, do their jobs 
with more acuity and impact than simple tools. But take a look at this elegant [transitional cutlery](https://example.com), or read about the sophisticated mechanism 
of the white cane for navigating through space, no electronics required. You might also be interested in another kind of cane when it meets a 
bike or body socks for [sensory processing challenges](https://example.com). And for more in-depth reading, see Audre Lordeâ€™s thoughts on the politics of old-school 
prosthetics for post-mastectomy and David Edgerton on the shock of the old.
