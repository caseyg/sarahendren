I just got back from round two of my four-week residency at the [Carey Institute for Global Good](https://careyinstitute.org/programs/nonfiction/). I was a Logan Non-fiction Fellow, working in the company of journalists, documentary filmmakers, and photojournalists on our respective longform projects addressing socio-political topics. It was a fantastic time, socially and for my book, and I was only able to do it because I asked the Carey folks to flex their structure for me. Normally stays there last between 4 and 10 weeks, and my life with three children doesn't allow for that. So I asked Tom Jennings, the director, if he could help me create a structure that *would* work, and together, we did. Two weeks at the start of the session, the better to cement my relationships with others who would just be arriving, and then two weeks near the end of the session. 

I'm reporting this in part to remind people who 1) do creative work and 2) have life ties and other constraints that you can ask for what you want. Having small children is just one of many situations that can keep us from getting some key support for our work, even in what may seem like small chunks of time: aging parents or other relatives in need of care; day job constraints; temporary or longterm health conditions among ourselvesâ€”each of these is a reality for many, many people. I am often easily inclined to forego applications for opportunities like this because they don't on the surface seem to accommodate my life. But asking is always worth the effort.  

But it's also worth reminding residency organizers of what may seem counterintuitive: that people like me can get a *lot* of work done in two weeks' time. I think the inherited idea of a residency is that protracted, uninterrupted time is
