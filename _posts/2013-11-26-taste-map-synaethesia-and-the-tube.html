<p>James Wannerton, head of the <a href="http://www.uksynaesthesia.com/" target="_blank">UK Synaesthesia Association</a>, has completed his nearly 50 year project to map the London Tube: by its tastes. Wannerton has experienced lifelong synaesthesia—an involuntary union of two or more senses that are ordinarily experienced discretely. For Wannerton, this means "lexical synaesthesia": for him, a consistent association with specific tastes that accompany the words at individual tube stops.</p>
