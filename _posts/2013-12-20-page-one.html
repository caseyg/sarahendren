<p>No one is more surprised than me that this follow-up story made it to the very first page of the <em>Boston Globe</em> last Saturday. <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/13/disability-icon-revamped-guerilla-art-project/HZDJAIORZvL68dukN9L0TL/story.html">Here's the full story</a>. The <a href="http://www.accessibleicon.org/">Accessible Icon Project</a> continues to outpace all our expectations for it. In the Wildest Dreams files: it has just been acquired for the permanent collection at MOMA, in the Architecture &amp; Design division.</p>
