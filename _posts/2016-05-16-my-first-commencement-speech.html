<p>Readers, there's a brand new site coming soon: a 3-part site, with lots of overdue documentation of new work, my lab, teaching, writing. The featured image is from a collaboration with <a href="http://alicesheppard.com/">Alice Sheppard</a> that I'll tell you all about. I can't wait! But for now—a commencement speech I gave for Olin's 2016 class. My first:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Congratulations, class of 2016. It’s an honor to be with you. I want to start with a story from candidates’ weekend this past February. As you all know, Candidates’ Weekends are when the applicants for admission who’ve made the first cut come to campus for a full weekend of events—events we design to help us understand them as people. You all did this some four years ago now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So one thing I did on Candidate’s Weekend was the solo interview session. The setup is three of us: myself, as the faculty member, plus one current student, and one recent alumnus sit together to ask a series of questions of these young people. And—they’re 17, right, so they’re nervous. It’s a profound and moving thing to see up close their quivering hands, their flushed cheeks. We try to set them at ease and to learn something in a short amount of time: about what makes them tick, what they’re passionate about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And at the end of each interview, as instructed, we allow for questions from the candidates themselves: and they </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> have questions—about Olin life, or what we like about engineering, things you would expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And on that day, these questions from the candidates were indeed more or less the usual fare. With one exception. We asked this one affable young high school student if he had any questions, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and without missing a beat, he said, right away, he said: “</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s up with the doors here?</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">” Just like that, totally unself-conscious. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s up with the doors here? </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">And my interview partners—the student and the alumnus—just *erupted* in recognition and laughter. Because apparently the doors at Olin are notorious among students for their poor design: it has been, for all these years, weirdly unclear whether and where you push or pull. It’s not intuitive where your weight should fall to hold them open. It’s awkward entering and exiting all over campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lots of Olin students have remarked on and complained about this phenomenon, and here was this young person: so immediately alert to the subtlety of this condition in his first weekend here, and brazen enough to call it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That guy got in. I checked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This young hopeful candidate for engineering school had found himself </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">among his people</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. And I’m happy to say that in the intervening weeks and months since then, somehow some door cues—saying “push here” or “pull” have mysteriously appeared on various handles around campus. Not sure who’s responsible for that, but someone got the message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Now. That story might seem like just a funny anecdote, but it actually reveals something big, I think, about engineering and engineers. Asking </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s up with the doors</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is more than an idle observation. I think it indicates a </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">way of being</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A lot of times engineering is framed as a penchant for problem-solving, in various permutations and with various caveats. Problem-solving: that is, skills and knowledge to materially improve the operations of the world.  You’ve heard this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s up with the doors, </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">I think, signals something more profound. It’s the full knowledge that the inherited conditions of the natural and built environment </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">need not be as they are</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. It’s the understanding that atoms and bits—the material and the digital—these conditions aren’t permanent. They don’t have to remain mysterious. Atoms and bits, bits and atoms: unlocked, un-black-boxed, malleable, contingent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">To understand the systems of the built world is to know, in your bones, something powerful: that </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">things might be otherwise</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. The doors, the engines, the mechanisms, the software and systems: you all know that these are the results of design decisions that can be reversed, unwound, utterly reconceived. Because you understand how they work. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s up with the doors</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> underscores that power, and it’s a power that you all now have. We send you out to the world with it. So: it’s a good day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">However</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I won’t cheapen this day by offering you a simple victory narrative. If only, IF ONLY the doors of the world were entirely made of wood and steel. If only it were so simple—to make the world better, just using atoms and bits.</span></p>
<p>Think about the doors of the immaterial kind: the portals, the thresholds, the entry points to human flourishing that are only open to some, and sealed shut for others. These are doors whose pushing open and pulling closed are social, political, interpersonal mechanisms—mechanisms that no amount of physics alone can sway.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words: to find yourself equipped as an engineer in the physical, technical sense—to be able to intervene and even dismantle the doors of the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">tangible</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">built</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> world—is still to find yourself an ordinary citizen with a much harder set of questions to engage. How do we share this planet? How do we talk to each other, people unlike ourselves? How do we grapple with the legacies of history? How do we build not only the future we can </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">construct</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, but the just and sustainable future we want to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">live in</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, one that includes all of us? To pry open and build these kinds of entrances, you will use your engineering, yes, but you’ll need so much more than that. You’ll need wisdom, and you’ll have to look for it and recognize it far outside of technology.</span></p>
<p>Be brave with these questions. Keep asking them. See that all kinds of openings and closings are everywhere.</p>
<p>And as you go out from here, know that the doors of this campus remain open to you.</p>
