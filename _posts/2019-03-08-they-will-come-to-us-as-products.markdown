>The discussion of biotechnology often centers on ethical questions, like when, if ever, inheritable genetic modification might be permissible or even desirable. These questions matter, but the actual choices will not occur in the rarefied atmosphere of bioethical discussion. They will come to us as products, which means that market forces will drive both which products are offered and the persuasion that accompanies them. Because the products need to answer to existing demand, they will reproduce the values of the society in which they are sold. To the extent that they are adopted, they will translate those values into human populations.

I'll be in discussion with George in Cambridge at the MIT Press Bookstore [next week](http://mitpressbookstore.mit.edu/event/george-estreich-and-sara-hendren-fables-and-futures/).
