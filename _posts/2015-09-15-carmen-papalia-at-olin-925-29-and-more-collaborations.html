<p>This fall's version of <a href="http://ablersite.org/investigating-normal/">Investigating Normal</a> will include several dream collaborators: Lacy Gillotti of <a href="http://neads.org/">NEADS</a>, a service dog training organization, Alex Geller of <a href="http://fathom.info/">Fathom Info</a>, with whom we'll be exploring disability and the school-to-prison pipeline, <a href="http://melchua.com/">Mel Chua</a>, a postdoc at Olin who is deaf, has spent her life "passing" as hearing, and will be getting a cochlear implant this fall, and <a href="http://blog.art21.org/2014/10/07/you-can-do-it-with-your-eyes-closed/">Carmen Papalia,</a> an artist who's blind and has a complicated relationship to the white cane.</p>
<p>Carmen will be here from September 25-29, doing an artist's "micro-residency," or so we're calling it at Olin. There are events on Friday, September 25 in the Olin Library that are free and open to the public. We'd love to see you there.</p>
