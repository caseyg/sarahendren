[[Part 1](https://sarahendren.com/2020/06/30/critique-or-repair-a-call-to-know-your-post/) is an opening set of thoughts about the affordances of critique and repair. Probably best to start there.] 

In my last post, I looked at critique and repair in the realm of speech acts—how we use our rhetorical efforts for building the worlds we want to see. I want to think a little bit about critique and repair in terms of making technologies, since that's the house where I professionally live. And it's on my mind especially with the high stakes coming up in the MIT Media Lab's new director hire.

I should say that I'm an invested outsider at the Lab, so my view is limited at best. I have given a handful of talks there over the last several years; I've sat on two thesis committees; I attend conferences and maintain relationships with students and researchers there. Most relevant, perhaps, is that every year I write recommendations for former students of mine who want to go there for graduate work. I did so in late 2019, approached by two extremely talented women who decided to throw their hats in the ring, hoping for the best despite the fresh stink of the news. And the thing is: I get it. I actually understood why they went ahead and applied. The Media Lab provides an exploratory and ambitious research latitude that, at its best, is hard to find elsewhere. So—with that good will in mind, I'll offer some thoughts about how its next director should think about shaping the Lab's future. Specifically, I want to offer thoughts on how to specifically shape the vague affirmation of "equity, inclusion, and collaboration" [that appears in the job listing](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/media-lab-director-search/). That vagueness is everywhere these days—organizations that understand the need to do better, structurally and culturally, but can't find the language to talk about how that works beyond recruitment/HR matters.
