[[Part 1](https://sarahendren.com/2020/06/30/critique-or-repair-a-call-to-know-your-post/) is an opening set of thoughts about the affordances of critique and repair. Probably best to start there.] 

In my last post, I looked at critique and repair in the realm of speech acts—how we use our rhetorical efforts for building the worlds we want to see. I want to think a little bit about critique and repair in terms of making technologies, since that's the house where I professionally live. And it's on my mind especially with the high stakes coming up in the MIT Media Lab's [new director hire](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/media-lab-director-search/).

I should say that I'm an invested outsider at the Lab, so my view is limited. I've given a handful of talks there over the last several years; I've sat on two thesis committees; I attend conferences and maintain relationships with students and researchers there. Most relevant, perhaps, is that every year I write recommendations for former engineering students of mine who want to go there for graduate work. I did so again in late 2019, approached by two extremely talented women who decided to throw their hats in the ring, hoping for the best despite the fresh stink of the news. 

And the thing is: I get it. I actually understood why they went ahead and applied. The Media Lab provides an exploratory and ambitious research latitude that, at its best, is hard to find elsewhere. So—with that good will in mind, I'll offer some thoughts about how its next director should think about shaping the Lab's future. Specifically, I want to offer thoughts on how to sharpen up the vague affirmation of "equity, inclusion, and collaboration" [that appears in the job listing](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/media-lab-director-search/). That vagueness is everywhere these days—organizations that understand the need to do better, structurally and culturally, but can't find the language to talk about how that works beyond recruitment/HR matters. So, in no particular order:

**— Build an undivided house for critique and repair, and generate a shared vocabulary for recognizing and honoring each.**

The Media Lab professes to be working in an anti-disciplinary way; it aspires to mix the autonomous experimentation of the arts with a paradigmatic mandate to launch not just new technologies, but new fields of technological research. Judging from the informal surveys that I take when I speak there, the students who actually get in have very little or no training in the arts or humanities. I've learned to recognize the mostly straightforward and narrow claim for doing "art" that's common at the Lab and among tech folks generally: They mean that they want to see beautiful and elegant results from their technical work, and that they encourage some wacky or whimsical side projects on the path to technical feasibility. 

But critique and repair are ideas that really do mix the languages of artworks with engineering. Each *could* be quite robust at the lab, and getting clearer about them would assist the Lab's community in articulating its commitments to socio-political concerns. How? 

Let's call "repair" mode, in the technical sense, the best-case version of new technologies (or technical research fields) that come into the world for the net benefit of humankind. This alone is a whole universe of debate, of course, but let's say that horizon is more or less the status quo of much engineering education—and that when it's in fact the best-case scenario, the world gets important tech that it needs.

"Critique," in the technical sense, has been a matter of concern at the Lab, but not nearly enough defined, and, judging from some of the departures from the Lab, not nearly enough supported with clear reasoning and welcome. Leah Buechley, Sputniko!, Ethan Zuckerman, and others ran groups doing technological repair work. They also supported parallel lines of study in the mode of critique: They made political inequities plain and visible to the public. They utilized technologies to dignify marginalized modes of craft. They allowed questions to be posed in artifacts, and they let them live *as* questions, without resolve. This is critique! Technological critique is the articulation of urgent socio-political questions made real in things.

It would be easy to find this a "sides" matter— as though you're either someone who's optimistic about technology for its own sake, OR you're someone who's on the right side of history, thinking and acting in the pursuit of justice. But the possibility is eminently available to build an undivided house–one where critique and repair are seen as complementary (if sometimes contentious) modes of research, and where the opportunity to mix and build a big body of work that contains both is convivially welcome. An undivided house requires a deeply pragmatic commitment to the values of each mode—explicitly named, used as a vocabulary from students' first days, and richly informed in its nuances. Mitigating this division and building that literacy requires most of all that the Lab's leadership adopt an explicitly relational theory of change, which I'll get into further in a later point.      

— Rethink the metrics of impact.

— Reconfigure the "Director's Fellows" program.

— Adopt an explicitly relational model of change.
