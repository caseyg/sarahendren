[[Part 1](https://sarahendren.com/2020/06/30/critique-or-repair-a-call-to-know-your-post/) is this set of thoughts about the affordances of critique and repair. Probably best to start there.] 

In my last post, I looked at critique and repair in the realm of speech acts, mostlyâ€”how we use our efforts for building the worlds we want to see. I want to think a little bit about critique and repair in terms of making technologies, since that's the house where I professionally live. And it's on my mind especially with the high stakes coming up in the MIT Media Lab's new director hire.

I should say that I'm an invested outsider at the Lab, so my view is limited at best. I have given a handful of talks there over the last several years; I've sat on two thesis committees; I attend conferences and maintain some relationships with students and researchers. Most relevant, perhaps, is that every year I write recommendations for former students of mine who want to go there for graduate work. I did so in late 2019, approached by two extremely talented women who threw their hats in the ring, hoping for the best, despite the fresh stink of the news.
