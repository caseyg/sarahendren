— This was [a good conversation with Austin Kleon](https://pioneerworks.org/broadcast/austin-kleon-interview/), and reminds me of how my friend Chad always says, half-serious: Curiosity is a holy thing.

>Two is a pattern for me. If somebody mentions noodles in an email, and then I'm watching TV later and somebody's eating noodles, I write it down, and think about what kind of message it could be. I know it's not real, but that sort of dumb "everything could be a secret message" attitude seems to open up a possibility space for me, activates the playful wiring in my brain that gives me ideas. I think collage is an art form that actively invites these weird patterns: you'll be making a collage, and see two elements juxtaposed, and it'll create a third thing in your brain.

— Still thinking about Michael Downing, whose obit is [here](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?n=michael-downing&pid=197717553), but it's [this short interview](https://now.tufts.edu/articles/love-letter-classroom) that stays with me:

>“We tend to be defensive of our work. We want it to be received well, to be instantly commended for what we’ve done. But the creative writing classroom is a place to develop the habit of wanting our original work to change,” Downing said. “That to me is the project of a life—to change, and to be changed by the people you encounter.”
