— Since reading *The Hobbit* to the kids, I picked up [Humphrey Carpenter's biography of J.R.R. Tolkien](https://bookshop.org/books/j-r-r-tolkien-a-biography-9780618057023/9780618057023). I keep thinking about this passage: 

>[Tolkien] managed to find books of medieval Welsh, and he began to read the language that had fascinated him since he saw [as a child] a few words of it on coal-trucks. He was not disappointed; indeed he was confirmed in all his expectations of beauty. *Beauty*: that was what pleased him in Welsh; the appearance and sound of the words almost irrespective of their meaning. He once said: "Most English-speaking people, for instance, will admit that  *cellar door* is "beautiful," especially if dissociated from its sense (and its spelling). More beautiful than, say, *sky*, and far more beautiful than *beautiful*. Well then, in Welsh for me *cellar doors* are extraordinarily frequent."

—  From Gail Heidi Landsman's *[Reconstructing Motherhood and Disability in the Age of "Perfect" Babies](https://bookshop.org/books/reconstructing-motherhood-and-disability-in-the-age-of-perfect-babies-9780415917896/9780415917896)*, a book about mothers of children with disabilities—a subject of much cultural patronizing and sentimental dismissal: 

>The overarching question I have asked is not how do mothers cope, but rather, what have they *learned*? [...] I did not set out to help mothers but rather to explore what women who nurture young disabled children have come to know about what it means to be a person.
