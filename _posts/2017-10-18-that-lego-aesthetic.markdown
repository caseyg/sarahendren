I had to sit through the latest LEGO Ninjago movie recently: a treat for two of my children but not for me. The story elements were hopelessly thin, but I did marvel at the particular mix of animation and plastic realism that is used for the treatment of the blocks and parts themselves. So much effort toward creating the scrapes and wear of the bricks, with a stylized totality as foil. I spent the hour-and-change trying to generate a vocabulary for this particular aesthetic: Seamful Volumetrics? Articulated Structuralism?
