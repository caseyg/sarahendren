<p>There's much more detail to come on this, but you can see <a href="http://mediacityseoul.kr/2016/en/project/under-momentum">here</a> some images from Slope : Intercept's most recent iteration, a collaboration with dancer <a href="http://alicesheppard.com/">Alice Sheppard</a>. MediaCity Seoul invited me last year to design some ramps for the biennial that opened last month (September '16), and in the meanwhile, my lab <a href="http://aplusa.org/projects/ramp-alice-sheppard/">worked with Alice over the winter</a> to design a giant ramped stage.</p>
<p>A secondary outcome of that design work was what I've been calling this "platform kit"â€”a modular set of ramps that include <a href="http://slopeintercept.org/suite-of-5-boston-2013/">my original design for single steps and skateboarders</a>, plus medium-scale ramps and interlocking dance tiles. The result was a workshop and performance with Alice in Seoul for the show's opening, plus plenty of interactions with disability advocates doing grassroots work. Here Alice is performing on the kit in front of Seoul Art Museum's main downtown site. The kit will remain up through November for wheelchair users, skateboarders, bikers, scooters, and more. See below some alternate uses we've tracked at the Buk Seoul museum site, and more info at <a href="http://mediacityseoul.kr/">MediaCity Seoul</a> online.</p>
