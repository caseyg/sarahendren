<p><a href="https://medium.com/weird-future/9caa2588d7ac">I talked to Tim Maly about my work</a>, and especially my ongoing project about Galileo's inclined plane, <a href="http://slopeintercept.org/">Slope : Intercept</a>. Here's an excerpt from the <a href="https://medium.com/weird-future/9caa2588d7ac">full article</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Spend some time with Hendren and you’ll find yourself in a conversation that veers wildly between fashionable hearing aids, Braille tattoos, the design of space suits, the relation of curb cuts to gentrification, and the origins of the smooth curves of the Eames Chair in the lacquered wooden leg splint that Charles and Ray designed for the US Navy.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Her own projects tend toward the informal and the temporary. She seeks out what she calls the margins of design: work that’s happening away from the spotlight of the mainstream tech and design press, “either because they’re made of low-cost materials, or in informally organized settings, or because they happen in the context of, say, special education.” Her low-tech approach allows her to intervene and launch discussions in graphic design, architecture, and prosthetics.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“All of these fields are professionalized for good reasons — standardization of practice and form,” she says. “But you can easily get some calcification around the ‘proper channels’ for the way things are done.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Defining what counts as health, as normative experience, as quality of life — these are easily as much cultural questions as they are about statistics and data,” she says. “I want the latitude, as an amateur, to also ask those questions in public, to engage with specialties as much as possible as an outsider.”</p>
