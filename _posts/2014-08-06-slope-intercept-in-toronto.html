<h3>Next Thursday and Friday, August 14 and 15, I'll be back in Toronto with <a href="http://interaccess.org/">Interaccess</a> and the <a href="http://idrc.ocad.ca/">Inclusive Design Research Centre</a>, to give a lecture and run a workshop and panel based on my ongoing project, <a href="http://slopeintercept.org/">Slope : Intercept</a>. All of it is free and open to the public, held at 49 McCaul Street, so please come! A public lecture is from 4-5 on August 14th, and the workshop and panel runs on the 15th, from 9-12. More details at <a href="http://interaccess.org/blog/2014/jul/waking-machines-assistive-technologies-and-prosthetic-agency">Interaccess</a>.</h3>
<h3>The workshop and forum in particular are what I've been planning as the next step in the project—to make my <a href="http://slopeintercept.org/suite-of-5-boston-2013/">material design</a> become a catalyst for highly localized public discussions about built environments for leisure and access, politics and play, wheeled mobility in multiple senses. Skateboarding and wheelchair use.</h3>

<h3>I'm particularly excited about the workshop and panel on Friday, from 9-12 noon. We'll be exploring a set of city blocks in central Toronto and making an alternate map of that part of the city with new eyes: thinking about deliberate, overlooked, and even accidental features of the architecture and landscape that make cities hospitable or hostile to wheeled mobile gear.</h3>

<h3>Joining us will be <a href="http://www.wcsk8.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159:ariel-stagni&amp;catid=25:staff-bios&amp;Itemid=81">Ariel Stagni</a>, Toronto skateboarder, skating advocate, and design &amp; programming advisor for skate spaces; Luke Anderson from the <a href="http://stopgapblog.blogspot.com/">Stop Gap project</a>, an activist wheelchair-ramp design initiative; and others from the Toronto architecture and planning professions. We'll meet at 49 McCaul Street in Toronto at 9, and we'll spend from 9 am - 11 am exploring the city and making a collective alternate map.</h3>
<h3>At 11, the discussion becomes a formal panel, with Ariel, Luke, and others talking about the future of Toronto and other cities: whose bodies are welcome, and how, and why?</h3>
