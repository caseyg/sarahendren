This is about the role of the insider professor and the role of the drop-in outsider. What do each bring to students, and how can we build structures that support each? In particular thinking of what next for Mellon: short term micro-residencies at others' schools that would allow drop-in rejuvenation of curricula, extra-specialist engagements, parallel and cross-over topics, interdisciplinarity without naming it as such, etc.
