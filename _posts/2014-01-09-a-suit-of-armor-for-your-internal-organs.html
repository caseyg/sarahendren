<p>German CGI design firm <a href="http://www.viaframe.de/en/portfolio1/armor1.html" target="_blank">Viaframe</a> imagined these <a href="http://www.viaframe.de/en/portfolio1/armor1.html" target="_blank">sets of armature</a> for a body's fleshy inner parts. A solid casement for your heart, lungs, or brain.</p>

They conform to the shapes of the organs precisely, showing their enigmatic structures, isolating their particular functions." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/giz2012-05-29_herz_ruestung_900px.jpg" width="610" height="406" /></a></p>
<p>They're an interesting thought-experiment around what's happening, research-wise, at the cellular and molecular level. How do you protect an organ system? What makes it robust and thriving, instead of susceptible to disease?</p>

<p>And what relationships, if any, are there between these kinds of speculations and the current models for replacement limbs that <em>do</em> exist? Perhaps it's utter fantasy, but these caught my eye as a thinking-through-images.</p>
