It can often seem that radical politics is only a politics of undoing and subverting. These activities are necessary, but they are not sufficient to the task of challenging status quo arrangements of power and privilege. This is because highlighting problems of political understanding and policy is not enough, particularly if it is carried out in language that is careless about whether it is intelligible to the ordinarily competent person.

>Some might argue that this kind of political pragmatism is the antithesis of radicalism. But I see no reason why that should be the case. If we take the meaning of the word "radical" seriously, as derived from the Latin *radix*, or root, it means to think, speak, or act in a way that affects the fundamental natuer of a thing, specificially, of political and social arrangements.
