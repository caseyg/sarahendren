To whom it may concern:
We, the parents of Graham Funck’s classmates over the course of his elementary school career, are writing to urge CPSD in the strongest possible terms to allow him to continue his education fully included with his peers as they transition to PAUS.  
With the help of his parents, his dedicated assistant, and the great team at Morse Elementary, Graham has made great academic progress and, more importantly, has become a highly respected and beloved member of his community of peers.
It would be difficult to overstate both how vital Graham’s full inclusion with his peers has been to his sense of acceptance and belonging, and how valuable having a friend like Graham has been to his typically developing peers.
Graham’s infectious smile, and the courage he shows every day by taking on challenges made more difficult by his extra chromosomes, have taught everyone around him an enduring lesson in respect, empathy, and the acceptance of people who are on a different developmental path.
As Maya Angeluo said, “It is time for parents to teach young people early on that in diversity there is beauty and there is strength.” Graham’s FULL inclusion with his peers does exactly that on a daily basis.
In conclusion, we strongly urge CPSD to provide Graham with the tools he needs to continue his education together with his classmates
