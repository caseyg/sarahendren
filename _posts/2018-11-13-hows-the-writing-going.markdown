Terrified of being plodding. Terrified of being sentimental. Terrified of not remembering to cite every source I think I should, though some inadvertent omission despite all earnest attempts is inevitable. Terrified of false attribution of ideas to me, even when citation is present. Terrified of dumbing down. Terrified of being ignored. Terrified of saying too little, or saying too much. In summary: it's going great.
