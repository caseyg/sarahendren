>And no list could hold what I wanted, for what I wanted was every last thing, every layer of speech and thought, stroke of light on bark or walls, every smell, pothole, pain, crack, delusion, held still and held together—radiant, everlasting.

—Alice Munro, *[Lives of Girls and Women](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375707490)*
