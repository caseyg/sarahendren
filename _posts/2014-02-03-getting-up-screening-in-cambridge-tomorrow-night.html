<p>Tomorrow night, I'll be a panelist for a screening and discussion of <a href="http://boston.reelabilities.org/films/view/getting-up">Getting Up</a>, one of the films being shown at the <a href="http://boston.reelabilities.org/films">ReelAbilities festival</a> here in Boston. The film covers the story of Tempt One, a graffiti artist in LA who is diagnosed with ALS; he goes on to co-develop <a href="http://www.eyewriter.org/">The Eyewriter</a> technology. This project has gotten lots of press; it's great to see the film walk us through the whole story of Tempt himself, how many collaborators joined this projects, their trial-and-error process, and the community of Tempt's family and friends along the way. <a href="http://boston.reelabilities.org/films/view/getting-up">Details here</a>, and below is the trailer:<br />
