"In thought as in life, the only surpassings we know are concrete, partial, encumbered with survivals, saddled with deficits."

That's Maurice Merleau-Ponty, in *[The Visible and The Invisible](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780810104570),* by way of Maxine Green's *[The Dialectic of Freedom](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780807728970).* Greene is reminding us that, of course, dialectics never lead to some "perfect synthesis or harmony." Yes, naturally. And *saddled with deficits* is easy to understand, but *encumbered with survivals*â€”that's something I'll be thinking about for a while.
