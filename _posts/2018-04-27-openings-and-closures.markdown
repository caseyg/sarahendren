One of the themes of my book is about how all states of the body and its gear make for openings and closures in a life. It will never suffice to describe someone as "bound" to a wheelchair or "suffering from" autism, and it will never be really truthful to say that a technology "gave someone her life back." Any real story, closely attended, will show itself to be far, far more interesting. [Every body is a patchwork](http://sarahendren.com/2018/02/08/say-instead/). All states of being come with possibilities and impossibilities, gradations of change, capacities that may diminish while others open up, all in a dance that is with and without design and technology. Some conditions, as in the case of true disease, we would of course wish away. But others make us who we are, and the line is blurrier than the common narratives would have us believe. It's a state of dynamism for everyone, full stop. Once you see that to be true among people with disabilities, you may feel invited ourselves to recognize that same dimensionality, to recognize you share it.

I won't be writing about my own experience with technology so much in the book, but I've been thinking about it
