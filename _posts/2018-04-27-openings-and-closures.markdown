One of the themes of my book is about how all states of the body and its gear make for openings and closures in a life. It will never suffice to describe someone as "bound" to a wheelchair or "suffering from" autism, and it will never be really truthful to say that a technology "gave someone her life back." Any real story, closely attended, will show itself to be far, far more interesting. [Every body is a patchwork](http://sarahendren.com/2018/02/08/say-instead/), which means that all states of being come with possibilities and impossibilities, gradations of change, capacities that diminish while others open up, all in a close orchestration that plays out with and without design or technology. Some conditions, as in the case of true disease, we may well wish away. But others make us who we are, and the line is blurrier than the common narratives would have us believe. It's a state of dynamism for everyone, full stop. Once you see that to be true among people with visible disabilities, you may feel invited yourself to recognize that same dimensionality, to recognize you share it.
