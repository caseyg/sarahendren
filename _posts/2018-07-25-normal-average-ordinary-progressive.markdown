I'm still in want of a title for my book, and since talking with [Florence Williams](http://www.florencewilliams.com/) about it, I'm thinking of MISFIT—or some variation of its ilk—as central to a final candidate. Florence generated MISFIT as an idea without having a real sense of the term as a formal one in disability studies, first articulated and coined by Rosemarie Garland-Thomson in [this terrific article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01206.x), which I recommend so strongly for people who are trying to get their hands around a social model of disability as it plays out in design. "Yes!" I said. "Misfit is a term in disability theory, but it's also easy to understand." *Misfit* places the locus of disability as happening not solely on the individual bodies of people, and not, conversely, purely in discourse and nomenclature, but also in the very stubborn materiality of the world. It's a signal about the well-established social model of disability, but encapsulated in an accessible word. 

Gardland-Thomson doesn't engage design in the article as such, but all the implications are there, and making those linkages is what I hope to do in my book (alongside Aimi Hamraie's [Building Access](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781517901646) and Elizabeth Guffey's [Designing Disability](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781350004276)). And more—I want these ideas to come alive in stories, with the complexity to be represented in people and things—people in their own words and the specificities of design as it plays out across scales: products, environments, systems.
