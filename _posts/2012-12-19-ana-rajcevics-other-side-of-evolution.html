<p>Ana Rajcevic's collection, <a href="http://www.anarajcevic.com/animal/studio/">ANIMAL: The Other Side of Evolution</a>, proposes a set of wearables that explore "animal anatomy, building upon existing skeleton structures to create a series of sculptural pieces that appear as natural properties of the human body."</p>

A woman wears an adornment that perches at the bridge of the nose and wraps up and around the head like a horn, ending in a narrow tail at the back of the skull." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/31_ana-rajcevic-animal-06.jpg" width="500" height="625" /></a></p>
<p>Made of gelcoat, fiberglass, resin and silicone rubber, the suite of works form "a collection of 8 pieces of personal adornment that would not be specifically categorised as jewellery or accessories. The idea was to step out of the traditional jewellery/accessories context in order to develop a ‘new breed’ of precious objects that can be exhibited both separately on their own and fully attached to the human body."
