<p>The <a href="http://www.fireflyfriends.com/" target="_blank">Firefly Upsee</a> is a walking baby carrier, designed to give the experience of ambulation to children who have motor delays or mobility restrictions. It brings the child upright, anchored closely to a caregiver, while also leaving her hands free to explore and play.</p>

<p>The design is a collaboration between Debby Elnatan, the Israeli mother of a child with cerebral palsy who had solely used a wheelchair to get around, and the <a href="http://www.fireflyfriends.com/" target="_blank">Firefly team</a> at the Leckey design company. Developed by a collaboration among clinicians, engineers, therapists, and textile experts, the design will come to the market in early April. <a href="http://www.fireflyfriends.com/webinar" target="_blank">There's a free webinar</a> for professionals in physical therapy fields and others.</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to watch what the user-consensus yields about its uses as a therapeutic tool—how its loadbearing structure affects these young growing bodies with varying degrees of muscle tone and postural challenges.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest intervention here is a social, interactive one: So many therapeutic tools for motor skills help a child to "have fun" while working muscles and strengthening stamina, but in isolation. But this tool fundamentally brings children into the eye-to-eye world of their typically-developing peers. The social brain is so foundational to global development, and it's fed in part by reciprocity, touch, and eye contact. The <a href="http://www.fireflyfriends.com/" target="_blank">Firefly Upsee</a> brings its users into upright space, yes—but into relational space too.</p>
