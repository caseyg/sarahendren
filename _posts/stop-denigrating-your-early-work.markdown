Khakpour: I've been thinking a lot about your first book, Grimus, actually...

Rushdie: Nobody really liked it when it came out...except Ursula LeGuin. She's been my loyal critic from the very beginning.

Khakpour: I think it's a great first novel.

Rushdie: You do? Well, thank you. I'm not so sure myself. [Laughter.] After it came out and after its really quite poor reception, I did a lot of rethinking about why I think is wrong about it, never mind what other people said. And that process of rethinking is what led me eventually to Midnight's Children. It was partially a way of rejecting what I was trying to do in my first novel; [in] that, I found my way. So in my head that's a book that I rejected in order to discover my path. I think it's a book in which the author has not found his voice yet. I think it's kind of erratic. There are passages that I think are really embarrassing. So I don't look at it very often.
