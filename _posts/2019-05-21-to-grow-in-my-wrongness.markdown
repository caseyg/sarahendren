>The work of a critic at one point was—and maybe still is—to imagine themself as a person who was certain enough to tell people what they should and shouldn’t be listening to. I don’t know if I have that desire anymore, and I don’t know if I ever did. I have a desire to be wrong. I’m kind of governed by this desire to be wrong. My interest in writing isn’t always to be right; it is to find a better path to figuring out where my wrongness stems from. I want to grow in my wrongness, and that doesn’t always mean being right at the end of growing.
