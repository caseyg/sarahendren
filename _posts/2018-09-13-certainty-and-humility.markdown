Talking with Rick about the humility of sciences: trying out an idea and then bein confronted with the hard facts of physical laws that will not bend to your will. Makes literary analysis look like quite a free and freewheeling enterprise. I'd always been trained to see the sciences as overly invested in certainty, but when you think about it Rick's way, a new light falls on the possibilities for STEM.
