I always chafe at the notion that once a professional becomes a parent, all other ambitions fall a distant second to the new identity of caregiving. It's not that I don't understand the broad brush of the sentimentâ€”because yes, of course, there's nothing like the commitment of parenting, like the arrival of a child. But the truth is more interesting than that, and I find myself trying to explain it these days.
