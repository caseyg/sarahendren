I always chafe at the notion that once a professional becomes a parent, all other ambitions fall a distant second to the new identity of caregiving. It's not that I don't understand the broad brush of the sentimentâ€”because yes, of course, there's nothing like the commitment of parenting, nothing like the arrival of a child to permanently alter a life. But the truth about work and parenting is more interesting than that, and I find myself trying to explain it these days.

To wit, here is one thing that is true: Parenting has an extraordinarily powerful and efficient headshrink effect on work-as-identity, work choices, day-to-day problematic work issues. My children are very proud of what I do professionally in the abstract, at the their young ages, but they don't *really* care about my job. And that fact is two-sided in the best way: They don't care if I was really good at it on any given day, and they don't care if I was a spectacular failure. Needless to say, this has a bracing and salutary effect on the ego.

And certainly, when I think about how best to use my time in a given week, or month, or year, I am considering who I want to be with them every bit as much as I'm considering my career. I am memorizing the freckle pattern on the one child's nose, and testing my back strength to speculate how much longer I can carry the other, when ragdoll tired at night, to bed. I am pleading with the neural functions of long-term memory to kick in at the sound of their voices and the wonky shapes of their emergent big teeth. Knowing them and shaping life with them is a force like the moon and the tide.

But here is another thing that is true: I am also alive and wildly ambitious in my work, because I am marking time in a way that's augmented by the idea of their lives in the future. How to do work that will at least be available to them, if to very few others? To be awake, naming the beauty and strangeness of this life: to be in it and giving it form. It's for me and for them.
