>“So do you really believe that in the future we’re going to have the kind of trouble you write about in your books?” a student asked me as I was signing books after a talk. The young man was referring to the troubles I’d described in Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents, novels that take place in a near future of increasing drug addiction and illiteracy, marked by the popularity of prisons and the unpopularity of public schools, the vast and growing gap between the rich and everyone else, and the whole nasty family of problems brought on by global warming. "I didn’t make up the problems," I pointed out."All I did was look around at the problems we’re neglecting now and give them about 30 years to grow into full-fledged disasters."

>“Okay,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?”

>“There isn’t one,” I told him.

>“No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke.

>“No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers–at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.”
