I came across [this conversation](https://www.pw.org/content/epic_an_interview_with_salman_rushdie) between Porochista Khakpour and Salman Rushdie last year, and the character of this exchange about Rushdie's first novel stayed with me:

> Khakpour: I've been thinking a lot about your first book, Grimus, actually...
> 
> Rushdie: Nobody really liked it when it came out...except Ursula LeGuin. She's been my loyal critic from the very beginning.
> 
> Khakpour: I think it's a great first novel.
> 
> Rushdie: You do? Well, thank you. I'm not so sure myself. [Laughter.] After it came out and after its really quite poor reception, I did a lot of rethinking about what I think is wrong about it, never mind what other people said. And that process of rethinking is what led me eventually to Midnight's Children. It was partially a way of rejecting what I was trying to do in my first novel; [in] that, I found my way. So in my head that's a book that I rejected in order to discover my path. I think it's a book in which the author has not found his voice yet. I think it's kind of erratic. There are passages that I think are really embarrassing. So I don't look at it very often.

Here's the [whole interview](https://www.pw.org/content/epic_an_interview_with_salman_rushdie) in Poets & Writers magazine. What's revealing about this is how Rushdie is equivocating between that familiar feeling of embarrassment about one's early work and the clarity to see that the early completed projects are usually (at the very least) a pathway to what becomes possible afterward. I just wish Rushdie could end on the more satisfied note instead of the hand-wringing.

And why? Because experienced creatives owe it to younger people to resist denigrating their own early work. It's a disservice to everyone when you try and erase the universality of growth and change—and above all, the absolute necessity of letting projects come to earth, housed not in the utopian version that can live forever unfinished in your head, but in the structure that they can live up to here in real life, in concrete form. It's crucial that younger people see the work go out even when it only reaches some fraction of its potential, because to finish—to let a work be called done, and then to learn from it—this is how creative people expand what they can do. Casting a rueful eye on the past just makes it harder for people starting out to shore up their courage and try.

If you have to disavow some body of your work, try and leave it out altogether and focus on other topics. But venting aloud about how ashamed you are of its
