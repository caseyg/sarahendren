—"Essentializing anything in order to contain or dismiss it is always a false friend to reform. For essentialism is extremism, extremism in its denial of plurality, possibility, ambiguity, double usage, multiple identities. The power of nominalism lies in saying this thing can be any number of things; we'll call it when we choose. Giving up essentialism isn't an academic move; it's a way of countering the fanaticism of the single cause. A left critique that employs it, however opportunistically, will soon find itself stranded on the extreme end of public argument. Intersectionalism in a sense does not go far enough. There are countless nodes on the network of social categories. We call each one a person.

So, liberals ask leftists to be extremely suspicious of a too-greedy or opportunistic essentialism that may help dismiss the critics today but that undermines the larger project of human emancipation, a project that depends, first and last, on being able to see past categories and types toward actual people and their predicaments. Antiessentialism is the universal solvent of illiberal thought." (Adam Gopnik, *A Thousand Small Sanities*, 179)
