<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/three_socks_huddled.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4577" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/three_socks_huddled.jpg" alt="Three figures, seated outside, huddled together in separate black lycra body socks, enveloping their entire bodies." width="610" height="406" /></a> Soon after I <a href="http://ablersite.org/2013/05/21/normalabnormal-in-prague/">posted</a> an image of my project <a href="http://sarahendren.net/2012/01/03/unknown-armature-body-socks/"><em>Unknown Armature: Body Socks</em></a>—that's another one, above—<a href="http://www.duanemclemore.com/">Duane McLemore</a> pointed me to these "<a href="http://http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/sets/72157594235409275/">entoptic phenomena</a>," William Hundley's photoset on Flickr: <a title="Untitled by albino_octopus, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/214212878/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/214212878_1e8d6274ed_o.jpg" alt="A floating rust-colored sheet of fabric seems to float, unaided, about 4 feet off the ground. The fabric is billowed and folded as though occupied inside, yet there's no evidence of a mass or volume that would occupy it." width="600" height="400" /></a> <a title="Untitled by albino_octopus, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/231399930/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/231399930_5dc34dc031_o.jpg" alt="A silk-satin, hot pink mass of fabric seems similarly occupied by a body, but floats in front of a shop window, unmoored." width="375" height="500" /></a> <a title="Untitled by albino_octopus, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/363560296/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/363560296_99525165c9_o.jpg" alt="A plain cotton sheet floats above the ground, seems to be inhabited by two human bodies." width="600" height="450" /></a> <a title="Smile Your Activities by albino_octopus, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/214205624/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/214205624_e4d7596c93_o.jpg" alt="A pink and blue printed sheet of fabric hangs suspended in the air, mountainous in its shape. In the background, a security sign on the wall reads: SMILE, your activities are being recorded..." width="600" height="460" /></a></p>
<p>I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entoptic_phenomenon">exactly zero sense</a> of how these are done, and I love that whatever anthropomorphism is present fades in and out of the set—appearing and disappearing. These images get at something far more effectively enigmatic than mine do. Like I wrote about <a href="http://sarahendren.net/2012/01/03/unknown-armature-body-socks/">here</a>, I've been interested in how dispersed the meaning of a body sock can become.</p>
<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/body_sock_products.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4588" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/body_sock_products.jpg" alt="Two body socks are occupied by wearers in a placeless white background. Image shows prospective users their range and reach of stretch in the fabric &quot;envelope.&quot;" width="488" height="582" /></a></p>
<p>A body sock is already an informal prosthetic, designed for people with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder">sensory processing disorder</a>, a condition that isn't recognized in the DSM but widely accepted and treated in schools and clinical settings, and often appearing in tandem with autism spectrum conditions. The sock provides a scrim, a filter for otherwise unregulated and overwhelming sensory stimuli. It allows you to be in public, and explore and play, without having to engage all the crash-bang of unmediated public space.</p>
<p>So I've been testing just how diffuse its meaning can become—that is, using a tool that is resolutely practical in its therapeutic design, but re-contextualizing it, sending it out in search of a new narrative, with a new set of users.</p>
<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_central_saraexplaining-600x450.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3879" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/sock_central_saraexplaining-600x450.jpg" alt="In Central Square, Cambridge, two women look on as a third tries on a green lycra body sock. I'm there, speaking with them about the project." width="600" height="450" /></a> <a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_central_tryingon2-600x450.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3880" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/sock_central_tryingon2-600x450.jpg" alt="A woman in Central Square dons the green fabric envelope, while her friends look on." width="600" height="450" /></a> <a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_sabrina_cityhall.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3874" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/sock_sabrina_cityhall.jpg" alt="A wearer inside the sock on a vast green space stretches and bends her knees against the lycra, dancing with its form." width="610" height="457" /></a></p>
<p>In this set of exchanges, I was part performing the role of educator: inviting people to try on this textile costuming, while also talking about sensory processing disorder if asked. But I was also interested in ways to hide in plain sight—indoors and out.</p>
<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_front_window-600x337.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3885" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/sock_front_window-600x337.jpg" alt="A body sock made from stretchy knitted lace, like so many front window curtains. The wearer steps inside the lace envelop and can disappear, perched in the window frame." width="600" height="337" /></a> <a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/blue_sock_close_sky-600x337.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3889" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/blue_sock_close_sky-600x337.jpg" alt="A body sock made of hombre-faded sky blue lycra. The wearer can perform it outdoors, blending into the skyscape behind her." width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>And these experiments took place in the context of Occupy events all over the country, so I was also thinking about these protestors in San Francisco. Ways to become amorphous, present but unreachable. The black blob effect:</p>
<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/black-blob.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4584" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/black-blob.jpg" alt="Several people share a single black body sock, seated on the street in San Francisco with an Occupy event. They resisted police arrest for 10 hours." width="600" height="448" /></a></p>
<p>So I had some black socks custom made, including a double version, for two wearers:</p>
<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/sock_double_white_van.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4591" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/sock_double_white_van.jpg" alt="Two wearers share a black double sock in a busy city square, while cars rush by in the background." width="610" height="406" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/three_socks_blackweb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4576" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/three_socks_blackweb.jpg" alt="Three wearers of individual black socks find hiding places in a building's &quot;cubby holes&quot; in its outer wall facade." width="610" height="406" /></a></p>
<p>But Duane also sent me to Kim Walker's <a href="http://kimberlycwalker.com/k/projects_exchange_show.html#grid"><em>A Social Exchange</em></a>, using large swaths of fabric in Exchange Square, a financial district in London that is all but unused on the weekends.</p>

<p>This beautiful video shows multiple scenarios and performances with bodies and textiles throughout the space.</p>
