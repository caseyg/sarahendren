I've been working with thesis students for some years now, at various institutions and in various roles. I've learned some things that may be worth collecting here, for folks who are in that stop-start process and struggling. Late fall tends to be the bottleneck for a lot of people: getting near to commitment time, but with enough runway to still worry-and-avoid on repeat. For what it's worth, some things to keep in mind are below. Might be useful for folks applying to grad school too.

—**Start with a heuristic of love.** The engine of any long-term project has to be one that has an engine of genuine enthusiasm behind it. It's better to collect the work you genuinely care about, genuinely believe in, to begin the process of figuring out your point of view, plan of study, your eventual contribution. Now—will your choices be subject to availability bias, to blinkered notions of importance? You bet! So yes—you'll apply a rigorous set of skeptical tests to your chosen loved subjects. But that's a second or third step. If you shoot down your first ideas even before they've made it to the page, you'll never get it done. So: start with your unedited enthusiasm, and let it live as such for a while. Then you can look at it more closely, playing the game of believing and doubting, namely:

—**Play the Believing Game and the Doubting Game, but not at the same time.** Longtime writing professor Peter Elbow [coined this idea](https://www.d.umn.edu/~cstroupe/ideas/believing.html#:~:text=The%20Believing%20and%20Doubting%20Games&text=The%20doubting%20game%20allows%20you,hard%2Dheaded%2C%20scientific%20skepticism.) of games for looking at the work of others, and it's worth applying to one's own work-in-progress too. The Believing Game is how you get that first draft down. It's that "yes, and" thing that people always understand about improv comedy but can never really bring themselves to do—because it means silencing the critic for a moment, and nurturing the seedling of an idea in its early form. But what if it's a bad idea, you ask? That's for the Doubting Game to suss out. The *game* metaphor matters—you start and stop; you play by its rules; you understand it as a suspension of other considerations for a time. Learn to play both, and not at the same time.
