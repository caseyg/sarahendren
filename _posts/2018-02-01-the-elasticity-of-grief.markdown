Twenty or so years ago, I was casual acquaintances with a woman who'd lost one of her three children to an accident. Her husband died suddenly of a heart attack less than a year later. My friend told me this on some Sunday afternoon without too much fanfare, perhaps because she was some distance from those events. Still: I was in my twenties then, and I'd never encountered a personal loss like this. So I must have pressed her on the matter. How does one survive? 

What she told me has stayed with me ever since: that her resulting grief then was, yes, a bigger grief than she ever thought possible. It was devastating; it hollowed out a giant space inside her. But, she said, the unexpected result was that *every* emotion was *also* more dynamic: that her happiness was also able to swell to a never-before range of emotion. That her laughs were the big-belly kind. She never once suggested that it was worth those events to experience those highs and lows. Of course not. But the elasticity of grief is something I think about all the time.
