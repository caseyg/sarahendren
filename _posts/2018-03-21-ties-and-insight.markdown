Jill Lepore on the writing of Rachel Carson, [in the new New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/the-right-way-to-remember-rachel-carson):

>Carson's father died in 1935, followed, two years later, by her older sister, leaving Carson to care for her mother and her nieces, ages eleven and twelve; she later adopted her grandnephew, when he was orphaned at the age of four. These obligations sometimes frustrated Carson, but not half as much as they frustrate her biographers. For [these biographers], Carson's familial obligations—in particular, the children—are nothing but burdens that "deprived her of privacy and drained her physical and emotional energy." They mean this generously, as a way of accounting for why Carson didn't write more, and why, except for her *Sun* articles, she never once submitted a manuscript on time.

>But caring for other people brings its own knowledge. Carson came to see the world as beautiful, wild, animal, and vulnerable, each part attached to every other part, not only through prodigious scientific research but also through a lifetime of caring for the very old and the very young, wiping a dying man's brow, tucking motherless girls into bed, heating up dinners for a lonely little boy. The domestic pervades Carson's understanding of nature. "Wildlife, it is pointed out, is dwindling because its home is being destroyed," she wrote in 1938, "but the home of the wildlife is also our home." If she'd had fewer ties, she would have had less insight.
