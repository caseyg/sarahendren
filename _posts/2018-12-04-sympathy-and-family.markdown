George Estreich's [opinion piece](https://theconversation.com/screening-the-human-future-youtube-persuasion-and-genetically-engineered-children-107938) on Chinese scientist He Juankui's claim to have produced the first [genetically edited babies]does a beautiful job of taking apart the narratives that tend to come with technologies like this(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fasia&action=click&contentCollection=asia&region=stream&module=inline&version=latest&contentPlacement=10&pgtype=sectionfront):

In it, he asserts that “the media hyped panic about Louise Brown’s birth as the first IVF baby.” Building on this theme in a second video (there are five in all), He inveighs against the phrase “designer baby,” contrasting “vocal critics” with silently suffering families.
