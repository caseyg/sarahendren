Semi-regular reminder that collaborative, ethical design is not synonymous with customer service, taking orders from “users,” retail-style. It’s synthesizing and recombining ideas from *insights* gained by deeply considered qualities of attention.

The implications of this are twofold, and people are forever forgetting either one or the other, ad infinitum.

The first is that—yeah, you can’t ask people a bunch of questions in survey mode, and then turn the magical crank of the design process to *automatically* make something good, something the world is asking for.

But the second is that a designer’s job is not to obediently make the precise widget described by so-called end users, to check a moral box and be sure that they did the right thing. Insights and synthesis are subtler than that.

A designer has to both be grounded in multiple forms of deep attention, not in simple yes-no answers, *and* she has to get liftoff from the mundane first ideas at hand—to take considered risks, to switch scales, to propose ideas that are bigger than the sum of parts.

Coda: It’s actually that second implication that’s harder for people to grasp. Yeah, the world is full of solutioneering; it’s also far too easy to wield a blunt moral cudgel to ethics-check people in a simplistic way. A plea for discernment and subtlety, folks; the end.
