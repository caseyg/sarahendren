>In order to work more intelligently, the whole practice of design has to be turned around. Designers can no longer be the employee of corporations, but rather must work directly for the client groupâ€”that is, the people who are in need of a product.

>At present the role of the designer as an advicate does not exist. A new secretarial chair, for instance, is designed because a furniture manufacturer feels that there may be a profit in putting a new chair on the market. The design staff is then told that a new chair is needed, and what particular price structure it should fit into.
>
>At this stage, ergonomics (or human factors design) is practiced and the designers consult the libraries of vital measurements in the field. Unfortunately, most secretaries in the United States are female, and more human factors design data, also unfortunately, are based on white males between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five...the data have been gathered almost entirely from draftees inducted into the [military branches]. Aside from some interesting charts in Henry Dreyfuss's *Designing for People*, there simply exist no data concerning really measurements and statistics of women, children, the elderly, babies, the deformed [sic], etc.
>
>At any rate, based on a manufacturer's hunch that a new secretarial chair might sell, substantiated by extrapolating and interpolating the measurements of Dutch pilots during World War II, and fleshed out by whatever stylistic extravaganzas the designer performs, the prototype chair is now ready. No begins the consumer testing and market research. Stripping this research of all the mystical clap-trap supplied to it by the snake-oil brigade from Madison Avenue, this means that a few chairs are either tested or sold under highly controlled circumstances. They may, for instance, be sold through a leading department store in six "test cities." ... Stores in which such testing is carried on are usually the leading shops or department stories in their line, catering to a white middle-class audience. So much for market research.

>Consumer testing is frequently done in one of two ways: either secretaries are urged to sit in the chairs for however long it takes them to type one sentence (after which their attention is directed towards the delicious upholstery color and texture)
