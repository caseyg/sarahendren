<p>I'm happy to be included in the May issue of Boston Magazine, themed around the <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/04/29/power-of-ideas/">Power of Ideas</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/power-of-ideas.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5474 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/power-of-ideas.jpg" alt="Thumbnail portraits from the Boston magazine story, overlaid by text reading &quot;POWER OF IDEAS.&quot;" width="610" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I've also had some great talks with various assistive tech journalists for stories and podcasts lately. They include a podcast interview for the <a href="http://www.eastersealstech.com/2014/02/21/atu143-sarah-hendren-abler-and-gizmodo-minimum-wage-for-people-with-disabilities-switching-from-mac-back-to-windows-csun-pre-conference-workshops-zoomtext-mac-update-app-drafts/">Assistive Technology Update</a>, produced by the INDATA project, and a radio conversation with the <a href="http://www.outofstep.com/toost-radio/riveting/riveting-5-sara-hendren/">Out of Step Tool group</a>, an economic services group for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>I've had some great exchanges with journalists for the Atlantic Tech channel in the last month. I'll do a separate post with excerpts from those.</p>
