>Not just professional mathematicians, but just about anyone lucky enough ever to have studied higher math understands what a pity it is that most students never pursue the subject past its introductory levels and therefore only know the dry and brutal problem-solving of Calc I or Intro Stats (which is roughly analogous to halting one's study of poetry at the level of grammar and syntax). Modern math is like a pyramid, and the broad fundament is often not fun. It is at the higher and apical levels of geometry, topology, analysis, number theory, and mathematical logic that the fun and profundity start, when the calculators and contextless formulae fall away and all that's left are pencil and paper and what gets called "genius," viz. the particular blend of reason and ecstatic creativity that characterizes what is best about the human mind. Those who've been privileged (or forced) to study it understand that the practice of higher mathematics is, in fact, an "art," and that it depends no less than other arts on inspiration, courage, toil, etc... but with the added stricture that the "truths" the art of math tries to express are deductive, necessary, *a priori* truths, capable of both derivation and demonstration by logical proof.

It may be that mathematics is not generally recognized as one of the arts precisely because so much pyramidal training and practice is required in order to appreciate its aesthetics; math is perhaps the ultimate in acquired tastes. And it's maybe because of math's absolute, wholly abstract Truth that so many people still view the discipline as dry and passionless and its practitioners as social dweebs.
