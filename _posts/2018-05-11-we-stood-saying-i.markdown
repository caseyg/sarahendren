Adrienne Rich's "In Those Years," which I came across today while re-reading some works of [Maxine Greene](https://maxinegreene.org/), the late philosopher who wrote so well about the arts, ethics, and the "social imagination" happening between and among people and artifacts. But Rich's poem here is something else again, and never more appropriate than now:

In those years, people will say, we lost track<br/>
of the meaning of we, of you<br/>
we found ourselves<br/>
reduced to I<br/>
and the whole thing became<br/>
silly, ironic, terrible:<br/>
we were trying to live a personal life<br/>
and yes, that was the only life<br/>
we could bear witness to<br/>

But the great dark birds of history screamed and plunged<br/>
into our personal weather<br/>
They were headed somewhere else but their beaks and pinions<br/>
  drove<br/>
along the shore, through the rags of fog<br/>
where we stood, saying I<br/>
