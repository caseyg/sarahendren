Speaking of [the language of mathematics](http://sarahendren.com/2017/11/23/math-melodrama/), Samuel Matlack has a piece in the latest New Atlantis, about how popular writers on physics invariably use poetic language to describe its workings, even in the face of the long-standing cultural idea that the sciences stand for the closest relationships between the names of things and what they represent. This was a beautiful meditation on the slippage of all communication—a subject of which I never tire. 

>But the language of physics itself...is often beyond translation into ordinary language, except in a very rough and poetic sense. And so physics, while sometimes presented as the ideal of scientific description that would overrule the ordinary, parochial, personal accounts of experience, depends for its verbal self-expression on the kind of language—poetic imagery—that we tend to think of as ancient and inferior.>

>language as we actually speak it inevitably involves ambiguities and tensions between various uses of the same words, that no perfect match between the logic of a language and the logic of the world exists, and that the meaning of words depends not on definitions nor the meaning of sentences on some fixed logical structure; rather, meaning depends on the shared contexts in which we speak in order to achieve certain purposes. 

While this is by far the more persuasive view of how language works, we might still say that the language of science can be seen as an attempt, however approximate, to achieve something akin to the early Wittgenstein's idea of a logically rigorous language that depicts the world in a one-to-one correspondence—a language whose scope, therefore, is strictly limited to what's describable. ... "a regimented language of accurate description and inference as the key to language in general." The type of language that's most useful in science is still often taken as a model for how to say anything true about the world. 

It's the reason I felt such an early affinity for the arts and humanities: they so readily accounted for the impossibility of describing the peculiar and specific parts of being alive, which is to say all the parts that . I've long been interested in language that opens up, more than the language that nails down. Precision is needed for both endeavors, but I like starting and ending with more questions than answers.

And that's why I
