<p>Industrial designer <a href="http://www.behance.net/chengsiewming">Siew Ming Cheng</a>'s "Spike Away" is your commuter-dream-come-true: a wearable way to guarantee you won't be up close and personal with the next person's breath and music and perfume.</p>

Sharp ends extend from shoulders and arms to indicate personal space.

<p><a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/fashion_design/commute_culture_may_have_just_peaked_with_this_passive_aggressive_fashion_26082.asp">​Core77 reports</a> that Cheng was part of a 2-day workshop on design addressing mundane problems, and she came up with this—a way to keep strangers at bay in crowded situations.</p>

<p>This is the kind of project dealing with everyday realities: wishes left unsaid, ideas unexpressed. What *would* be the right amount of space granted, and the right amount of flexibility for those around you? It's hard to say, exactly, but these devices start to imagine that negotiation.</p>

<p>Made from pre-fabbed strips of material designed to keep pets away from plants, these are wearable defensive mechanisms, for those brave enough to use them. More from <a href="http://www.behance.net/chengsiewming">Siew Ming Cheng</a>.</p>
