Rob Giampietro's [Lined and Unlined](https://linedandunlined.com/archive/being-available) had this excerpt from Lawrence Weschler's terrific book on the artist Robert Irwin, [Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees](http://shop.harvard.com/search/site/seeing+is+forgetting), way back in 2010. I had read *Seeing* in the late 90s and since then, I can pretty much predict that Irwin People will almost always be My People too. But in 2010, and now, the part that particularly resonates is this idea of Irwin's on teaching encounters: being *available in response.*
