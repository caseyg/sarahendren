Rob Giampietro's [Lined and Unlined](https://linedandunlined.com/archive/being-available) had this excerpt from Lawrence Weschler's terrific book on the artist Robert Irwin, [Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees](http://shop.harvard.com/search/site/seeing+is+forgetting), way back in 2010. I had read *Seeing* in the late 90s and since then, I can pretty much predict that Irwin People will almost always be My People too. But in 2010, and now, the part that particularly resonates is this idea of Irwin's on teaching encounters: being *available in response.*

>"I just sort of let it be known that I was available, in a way like I’m saying it to you. I mean, I didn’t put out any ads or anything, but word got around. And you could be, let’s say, up at UCLA, and you’d say, ‘Well, let’s take advantage of that. We’ll have him come up and talk to the students.’ And that’s what I’d do. Or, ‘We’ll have him come up and do a piece on the patio.’ And I would just come up and do that.

>There’s an important distinction to be made here,” [Irwin] continued, “between organizing and proselytizing, on the one hand, and responding to interest, on the other. I was and continue to be available in response. I mean, I don’t stand on a corner and hand out leaflets. I’m not an evangelist. I’m not trying to sell anything. But on the other hand, if you ask me a question, you’re going to get a half-hour answer.’"
