From the [Kansas City Star](http://aplusa.org/courses/investigating-normal/):

A sensitive and impassioned opinion piece about the tragic deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, made more urgent and complex by noting the context of doctor-assisted dying. 

>One aspect of this conversation that hasn’t been happening...and that will delight no one, involves the research that shows assisted suicide is also contagious.
>
>That’s right: Doctor-assisted suicide increases overall suicide rates among the non-terminally ill everywhere it’s made legal. Such laws have a measurable effect on those who aren’t dying, but who are suffering from depression.
>
>A study conducted between 1990 and 2013 and published three years ago in the Southern Medical Journal found the correlation unmistakable: “Controlling for various socioeconomic factors, unobservable state and year effects, and state-specific linear trends, we found that legalizing [physician-assisted suicide] was associated with a 6.3% increase in total suicides.”
>
>In Oregon, which legalized assisted suicide in 1997, suicide rates are more than 40 percent higher than the national average.
>
>And wherever doctors could legally help their worst-off patients end their own lives, more of those in acute but treatable, transitory, psychic pain followed suit.
>
>A study of New York cancer patients suggested that a high percentage of those terminally ill patients who expressed a “high desire for hastened death” themselves suffered from depression, so we don’t always know that even their final decisions are unclouded by a disease other than cancer.

[Links aplenty in the piece](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/melinda-henneberger/article213548244.html). Many of my friends on the left think of assisted dying as a rather simple matter of "choice"—and it's just more complicated. As the piece says, these laws are expanding and are lauded for their "compassionate" stance, but a rationale for dying that rests on the murky territory of "diminishing quality of life" is not something to be celebrated. It's a rationale that's historically been used to under-value the lives of people with disabilities: a situated and arbitrary definition of life worth living. 

When does a life worth living cease to become so? When one can no longer eat and must use a feeding tube? A ventilator? When one loses mobility, or memory? What about pain—can one live with a little, but not a lot? How much is a lot, exactly? And then there is the monster in its own category that is depression. I know many people living with each of these conditions, and the thing I know is this: the view from outside is invariably impoverished. The human brain just lacks the imagination to fathom a life lived well that is so physically or neurologically different from one's own. Living without capacities one has come to take for granted is only seen as *loss* of capacity, and therefore loss in total. A life no longer a life. But *ask* disabled people, and they will tell you: their lives are worth having. 

And yes, yes, yes of course this issue is absolutely fraught; it has no clear answers in an era when life is irreducibly extended with machines and medicine. So, sustaining life is artificial; perhaps ending it must also be so. And it is, in many cases—whether we call it non-intervention or something else. But let's be absolutely specific about the terms on which we grant such profound power, perhaps especially in a time when suicide rates are high.
