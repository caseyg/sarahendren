Don't volunteer other people's time! This is most benignly carried out when you send an unsolicited email "connecting" two people who "really should meet." I've absolutely been guilty of this, and now that I'm frequently on the receiving end of that kind of introduction, I see how unintentionally rude it is. You can't create a chain of obligation without asking if it's ok first. If you and I are colleagues or friends, it looks bad for me to do anything less than follow up...
