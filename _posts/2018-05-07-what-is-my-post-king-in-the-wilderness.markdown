To have one's own post, then, implies a couple of important things. A post has its importance, its location, its very particular work that only it can get done. But to have a post and to knowingly occupy it is to also acknowledge that others have their posts as wellâ€”their singular locations with their own boundedness and limitations and possibilities. Their post is not your post, and yours is not theirs.

This means you can waste your time critiquing the choices of others, or you can keep focused on the work that is yours. You can hurl your energy at the things going wrong elsewhere, or you can attend to the difficult business of building a whole ecology of actions that are, in their many tacit and nonlinear ways, all working toward a larger goal.
