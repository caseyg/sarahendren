[Jane Dryden](https://janedryden.weebly.com/) is working on disability theory, vulnerability, autonomy, feminism, and more. Looking forward to her book, but this interview hints at some her ideas:

>I’m interested in conceptions of our vulnerability that don’t just frame it as exposure to risk or harm, but as a fundamental openness to the world. So, think of the sort of vulnerability you need to have in order, for instance, to fall in love. Yes, you’re risking harm, absolutely, but you need to do so in order to love at all.

>When we have good relations with the people around us and when we understand how deeply embedded we are in those relations, I think these notions of autonomy and vulnerability work really well together, because the more we’re aware of our vulnerability, the more we’re aware of how we’re dependent on others and others are dependent on us.

>One of the risks of talking a lot about vulnerability is developing paternalistic attitudes. We do need to look out for people who are vulnerable in society, but we need to do it in a way that respects their autonomy. And by seeing that we’re all vulnerable, we can kind of resist that ‘us’ verses ‘them’ dynamic.

>we should be reconciled to this vulnerability. We should learn to love it, and not be trying to overcome it. There are a number of problems with that, for instance, there might be really good reasons for us to be angry or resentful of the sources of our vulnerability, especially for marginalised people. And so I examine what anger, and resentment, and even bitterness, can teach us. I also look at what we’re reconciling ourselves to.
