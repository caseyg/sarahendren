<p>I'm sitting on the thesis committee for a graduate student in biomechatronics—a PhD project that will be entirely technical. This student reached out to me to ask about placing engineering for disability in a larger social context, and I'm glad for the opportunity to think about what's an essential primer in disability studies, appropriate for a graduate-level young researcher whose preparation has been entirely in STEM. In case it's useful to others, here's what I'm suggesting:</p>
